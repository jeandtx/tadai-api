A Whiter Shade Of Pale,Procol Harum,A Whiter Shade Of Pale,0,"38 ContributorsA Whiter Shade of Pale Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

[Bridge 1]

[Verse 2]
She said, there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might have just as well've been closed
You might also like[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

[Bridge 2]

[Additional Verse]
She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
Though in truth we were at sea
So I took her by the looking glass
And forced her to agree
Saying, 'You must be the mermaid
Who took Neptune for a ride.'
But she smiled at me so sadly
That my anger straightway died

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale
[Verse 4]
If music be the food of love
Then laughter is its queen
And likewise if behind is in front
Then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
Seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
And attacked the ocean bed
[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale16Embed",320,7DsQgIwg23u9gooCxkRTu3,"{'danceability': 0.249, 'energy': 0.66, 'key': 0, 'loudness': -6.904, 'mode': 1, 'speechiness': 0.0343, 'acousticness': 0.514, 'instrumentalness': 0.00271, 'liveness': 0.0891, 'valence': 0.427, 'tempo': 149.822, 'type': 'audio_features', 'id': '7DsQgIwg23u9gooCxkRTu3', 'uri': 'spotify:track:7DsQgIwg23u9gooCxkRTu3', 'track_href': 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/7DsQgIwg23u9gooCxkRTu3', 'analysis_url': 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/7DsQgIwg23u9gooCxkRTu3', 'duration_ms': 248947, 'time_signature': 4}",0.249,0.66,-6.904,0.0343,0.514,0.00271,0.0891,0.427,149.822,248947,https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/0221204227043fdf9406e70b6b38a78c99f82373?cid=a4bf3a6d2a1640eeaff76c0764a15e10

It seems apparent that starin’ im incoherent

Transparent when people glarin'

Not caring’ my musics blarin' And'


I devour

The people begin to cower
The rifle up on the tower

Thats fired at every hour, Woah!


Somehow I never seem to give a Fuck

Got ahead and talk shit, I can't get enough

Throw your fist up, If you’re feelin' tough

Skinny young man through hands, like im hella buff


You chippin' from the rough, for the sandtrap

Im sittin' on the green fareway or the stairway, To

Heaven, Led Zeplin

Play it backwards, Its the password to get your ass hurt



So, Are you a bastard?
Sittin' at your local bar gettin' platered

Too fucked up, and you act a hazard

Please. You need to stay calm

I know I spit heat like a fucking napalm

Get to rowdy and you get a face palm. Wait

I dont give a Fuck cause im so, wait, GONE



Ive been drinkin too much liquor

Now my belly's getting sicker

Need find a girl to dick her dick her down. Dick her down

Pick her up and Dick her down

Make her world go round when I go down town. Pound



Pound on down them ovaries

Ain't nobody over me

Stickin through these women like im diggin through my groceries

Lets have a toast to me

Heres to what im supposed to be

Heres to when i hit it and remember who was close to me



Think before you say it with your mouth

Back when all I used to do was stay up in my house

Back when not a single so would care what im about

Saçım da soğuk bir rüzgar

Colitaların ılık kokusu

Gökyüzüne yükseliyor

Uzakta bir yerde

Parlak bir ışık gördüm

Kafam ağırlaştı ve görüşüm bulanıklaştı

Gece için durmam gerekti






Orda kapı yolunda duruyordu

Görev zilini duydum

Ve kendi kendime düşündüm

Çok sevimli bir yüz

Bazı danslar hatırlanmak içindir

Bazı danslar unutmak





Kaptana seslendim

""Lütfen bana şarabımı getir""

""Biz de 1969'dan beri o içki yok"" dedi

Ve hala o sesler çok uzaklardan çağırıyor

Seni gecenin ortasında uyandırır

Sadece şunu duyman için

Ve o dedi ki ""Burada hepimiz sadece kendimizin tutsağız""

Ve ana salonda

Onu çelik bıçaklarıyla doğradılar

Ama canavarı öldüremezler

In the Ghetto,Elvis Presley,Elvis 30 #1 Hits,52,"30 ContributorsIn the Ghetto Lyrics[Verse 1]
As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

[Bridge]
People, don't you understand
A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way?

[Verse 2]
Well, the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

The young man breaks away
He buys a gun, he steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far

And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Facedown on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
And as her young man dies (In the ghetto)
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

[Verse 1]
Finished with my woman
'Cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane
Because I am frowning all the time

[Verse 2]
All day long I think of things
But nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind
If I don't find something to pacify

[Bridge]
Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
I need someone to show me
The things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

And you will laugh and I will cry

Ooh-ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

[Verse 2]
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears, I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life, you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else
Instead

Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?

Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it

Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat

At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

One,U2,Achtung Baby,0,"46 ContributorsOne Lyrics[Verse 1]
Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you
Now you got someone to blame?

[Chorus]
You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

[Verse 2]
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

[Chorus]
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

[Verse 3]
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

[Bridge]
You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

[Chorus]
One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh), hey-ey

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

You'd leave me for somebody new

In the day, we sweat it out on the streets
Of a runaway American dream
At night, we ride through mansions of glory
In suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Yes, girl, we were

[Verse 2]
Wendy let me in, I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild, babe
I want to know if love is real
Oh, can you show me?

The Weight - Remastered,The Band,Music From Big Pink (Expanded Edition),0,"9 ContributorsWorld’s Greatest Lyrics[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
It's the world's greatest (Ruff Ryders)
Make you throw your bike's up
Make you rep your hood, now scream
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 1: Murda Mook]
I think I'm getting why these motherfuckers hate me
Cause I've been putting pressure on everything lately
And I'm here pressure bust pipes kinda easy
With that being said I apologize to BP
But to the rest of y'all it's no courtesy
I'm not a nest so won't none of y'all burden me
Next generation of the double R lights up
I'm the next nigga that's gon' make 'em throw they bikes up
I literally had millions watching me
On stage turning dudes to a mockery
Yeah they copy me with no cash
These niggas is chickens in beef
Steady talking bout they go ham
You confused, you meat lover
I got Swizz feeling like Dre when he made Deep Cover
I'm the next Double R meal ticket
Made like a deck of cards nigga, deal with it

[Hook]
You might also like[Verse 2: Drag On]
My flow dope like the methadone clinic
Pull on the Phantom when you see a don in it
Glove box you might see the Quran in it
Underneath the firearm, am I wrong with it?
I drop the roof to be captured by the sun
Relay my bars and remastered every one
Nigga's wondering where the fuck Drag at
I'm on Twitter hitting everybody back
Drag to the dash, I ain't back to claim shit
I still got the same crown I first came with
If I had to do it all again, I wouldn't change shit
Now I'ma shine when the rain get thick nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
All the pretty girls go round the outside
Porsche or the Range Rover, meet me in the ride
Windows all jet black you ain't gotta hide
Donnie, Razor Ramone, Bobby Backlund
This my throne cranberry silver patron, they love me
Hat back like I'm 15 face clean
Nice blue jeans sitting on the Louie
I used to run base and I don't mean ???
A long way from Dr Jays and Conways
I still like hoodrats, some Beyonces
Pop off you ain't ever seen AK's
Top down, Eddie Levert and the O'Jays
Donnie killing that UFO
It took a little while but Donnie gon' blow
Hater's seen Sheek nope, Donnie on the go
Might as well call me butter cause Donnie on a roll
[Hook]

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Ayo, personally I think I'm underrated if nothing else
Ask around, they'll tell you Jada is something else
Motherfuck who they know
It's the kid with the diesel bars and […] flow
It's a couple dudes I ain't got rid of yet
But it ain't no rush, niggas is butt like the back of the cigarette
Holla when it's time for the blood to get spilled
I only negotiate for thugs to get killed
Hustler, artist, CEO
On the low blowing strawberry Kiwi dro
Sling cane til they cut off my hands, other than that
I'ma spit pain til they cut off my glands
Got work all over the stove, getting money all over the globe
In the Range all over the road
Cribs and the whips is lavish
Double R mob life, Kiss a savage

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Styles P]
You know me, playing 'Kiss and Ne-Yo with your bitch
Or she can call time, run a trio on your bitch
Shoot 'em in the mouth, bet you he ain't gonna snitch
Fucking with 3 bad niggas
Telling your girlfriend to tea bag niggas
She's wavy, we crazy
ADHD, know where the weight be
On the scale with the guns off safety
Eyes hazy, money, mansion, Mercedes
Surrounded by killers, OG's, crack babies
Loading up the nine, dope stay a dime
Two blunts in the Watson 749
Red wine avocado, salad with the lamb and
Cilantro head honcho, rocking a poncho
Way out in Mexico
10 for the bird let you place the decimal
Turn your ass vegetable
[Hook]

[Verse 6: DMX]
You the next nigga, well, I'm the X nigga
Name still ringing bells so fuck the rest nigga
I do this shit for real, y'all niggas is acting
I'm old school like Andre the giant and Bob Backlund
Cats ain't never been able to ever
Fuck with the dog, whatever the weather
I come through, niggas bow down like Muslims praying
I'm just trying to understand what these fools are saying
Don't make me, somebody better take me outta here
This is what it came down to, fuck outta here
Cats gotta fear a nigga like me
I come through in beast mode from New York to AZ
Bitch you fucking crazy, thinking Dog ain't got it
Dog gon' hit it, as soon as soon as dog spot it
I'ma scratch to the death, till there's half of 'em left
I'm the last of 'em left, till the last of my breath

Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
Praise for the singing, praise for the morning
Praise for them springing fresh from the Word

Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from Heaven
Like the first dew fall on the first grass
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness where His feet pass

Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning
Born of the One Light Eden saw play

They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God, I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor
Sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time that he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Oh mother, tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun

Well, I've got one foot on the platform
And the other foot on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many young poor boy

Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls

She takes just like a woman, yeah she does
She makes love just like a woman, yeah she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Til she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls

She makes love just like a woman, yeah she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

Ain't it clear that I just can't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
But when we meet again, introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world

Get your motor runnin'

Wise men say
""Only fools rush in""

Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help
Falling in love with you

Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know and
Maybe there is nothing that I can do
To make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought just stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do

So I cry, and I pray, and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me

Leave me, leave me

That I had to come again
And show you that I'd win

All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Yes, I tried, yes I tried
You lied to me
Even though you knew I'd die for you
You lied to me
Yes, I cried, yes I cried

Fuck, you can't even sing

[Verse 1]
Early in the mornin', risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet
Got to find the reason, reason things went wrong
Got to find the reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot

[Verse 2]
Well, life is (Too short), so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static, I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty
Love is what I got, it's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve
Try and test that, you're bound to get served
Love's what I got, don't start a riot
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot

[Chorus]
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
And remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got

So long ago, I don't remember when
That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees

The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste, she always had a pretty face
So I wondered why she hung around this place

I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between
The city walls of dying dreams
I think her death, it must be killing me

To really love a woman
To understand her - You gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought - See every dream
And give her wings when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

[Verse 2]
To really love a woman - Let her hold you
'Til you know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her
'Til you can feel her in your blood
And when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that you'll always be together
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

You really gotta love your woman

Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

[Outro]
Yeah, just tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?
Oh, just tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?2Embed",351,32Gf5A7Hr8RdgggXG0Fdks,"{'danceability': 0.57, 'energy': 0.478, 'key': 7, 'loudness': -10.185, 'mode': 1, 'speechiness': 0.0322, 'acousticness': 0.536, 'instrumentalness': 1.33e-05, 'liveness': 0.0931, 'valence': 0.358, 'tempo': 145.517, 'type': 'audio_features', 'id': '32Gf5A7Hr8RdgggXG0Fdks', 'uri': 'spotify:track:32Gf5A7Hr8RdgggXG0Fdks', 'track_href': 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/32Gf5A7Hr8RdgggXG0Fdks', 'analysis_url': 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/32Gf5A7Hr8RdgggXG0Fdks', 'duration_ms': 291667, 'time_signature': 3}",0.57,0.478,-10.185,0.0322,0.536,1.33e-05,0.0931,0.358,145.517,291667,

Don't leave me in all this pain

Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me

I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police, catch me if you can
Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin, bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me; Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it

Get to rockin' these, nights full of Alizé
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
These niggas play these Cali days

Instead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that

Lickin' shots off from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it
How do you want it?

I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

When I dial the telephone

Sometimes I feel so insecure
And loves so distant and obscure

Only God can judge me (That right?)
Only God can judge me now
Nobody else (Nobody else)
All you other motherfuckers get out my business (Really)
Only God can judge me now

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus, try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, ‘cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use in tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
‘Cause the media is full of dirty tricks

Flatline
I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
‘Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me
I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up strangled, entangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse ‘cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
‘Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
""Black Power!"" is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
‘Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped
Mr. Police, please try to see
That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me

The same two brothers dodgin' bullets, representin' the Bay

Start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon
Still be draggin', sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise

How Bizarre,OMC,How Bizarre (Deluxe),67,"38 ContributorsHow Bizarre Lyrics[Verse 1]
Brother Pele's in the back, sweet Sina's in the front
Cruising down the freeway in the hot, hot sun
Suddenly red-blue lights flash us from behind
Loud voice booming, ""Please step out onto the line""
Pele preaches words of comfort, Sina just hides her eyes
Policeman taps his shades, ""Is that a Chevy '69?""

[Chorus]
How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre

[Verse 2]
Destination unknown as we pull in for some gas
A freshly pasted poster reveals a smile from the past
Elephants and acrobats, lions, snakes, monkey
Pele speaks ""righteous,"" Sister Sina says, ""funky""

[Chorus]
How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre
Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)
It's making me crazy (It's making me crazy)
Every time I look around (Look around)
Every time I look around (Every time I look around)

It's in my face

Ringmaster steps out, says, ""The elephants left town""
People jump and jive and the clowns have stuck around
TV news and cameras, there's choppers in the sky
Marines, police, reporters ask where, for and why
Pele yells, ""We're out of here,"" Sina says, ""Right on""
Making moves and starting grooves before they knew we were gone
Jumped into the Chevy, headed for big lights
Wanna know the rest? Hey, buy the rights

That knocks me off my feet
I finally found the one
That makes me feel complete
It started over coffee
We stated out as friends
It's funny how from simple things
The best things begin
This time is different
And it's all because of you
It's better than it's ever been
'Cause we can talk it though
My favorite line was
""Can I call you sometime?""
It's all you had to say
To take my breath away
This is it
Oh, I finally found someone
Someone to share my life
I finally found the one
To be with every night
'Cause whatever I do
It's just got to be you
My life has just begun
I finally found someone
Did I keep you waiting?
I didn't mind
I apologize, baby that's fine
I would wait forever just to know you were mine
You know I love your hair
Are you sure it looks right?
I love what you wear
Isn't it too tight?
You're exceptional
I can't wait for the rest of my life
This is it
Oh, I finally found someone
Someone to share my life

To be with every night

I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you

Wipe the spots up off the mirror
Don't leave my keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore 'cause

And soon you will see

Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up the paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken or people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain

'Cause it was happy or I was sad

Follow me into the desert, as thirsty as you are
Crack a smile and cut your mouth and drown in alcohol
'Cause down below the truth is lying beneath the riverbed
So quench yourself and drink the water that flows below her head

[Pre-Chorus]

Out in the sunshine
The sun is mine, the sun is mine

I lost my head again, would you lie for me?

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes and bow your head, I need a little sympathy
'Cause fear is strong, and love's for everyone who isn't me
Kill your health and kill yourself and kill everything you love
And if you live, you can fall to pieces and suffer with my ghost

I left her in the sand, just a burden in my hand

Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

In the government yard in Brooklyn
Oba-observing the crookedness
As it mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had, oh, good friends we've lost

In this great future, you can't forget your past

And little Georgie would make the firelight
As stolen cars passed through the night

Touching my private parts
And just the thought of you
I can't help but touch myself
That's why I want you so bad
Just one night of moonlight

You know I want you so bad

I've been watchin' you from afar
For as long as I can remember
You're all a real man can need
And ever ask for
This is love, girl
This is more than a crush
Yeah

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
It was Harlem at the Ruckers, I saw ya with your man
Smilin', huh, a Coach bag in your hand
I was layin' in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
So I skated off, as you strolled off
Lookin' at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (So fine)
I gotta take ya from your man that's my mission
If his love is real he got ta handle competition
You only knew him five months (That's right)
Besides, he drink too much and smoke too many blunts
And I be workin' out everyday thinkin' bout you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catchin flash backs of our eye contact
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years

I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
But I don't want to violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
Still, he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tonguin' you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs under moonlight
Searchin' your body with my tongue, girl, all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams could turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the aisle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead
Hey lover

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standin' at the pay phone 'bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Tellin' you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about travelin' the distant lands
Escapin' all the madness out here in the world
Becomin' my wife, no longer my girl
Then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparalleled
Into an ocean of love, we both fell
Swimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchangin' with each kiss
Undyin' passion unites our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control, but
It's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swear he love you
So I'm a keep all these feelin's inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

Barely Breathing,Duncan Sheik,Duncan Sheik,61,"7 ContributorsBarely Breathing Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

[Verse 2]
And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day

When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

If you cared you'd be there like you used to be, yeah
I'm searching for the words to make you realize
That I really, really want you to stay
Tears of frustration I hold inside
But if you walk away you'll make this grown man cry

Don't leave (No, baby, no, baby, no, baby)
Don't leave me, girl (No, no, please)
Please stay with me tonight (No, baby, no, baby, no, baby)

Guess Who's Back,Rakim,The 18th Letter / The Book Of Life,59,"48 ContributorsGuess Who’s Back Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
""Once again, back is the incredible""

[Verse 1]
It's the return of the Wild Style fashionist
Smashin' hits, make it hard to adapt to this
Put pizzazz and jazz in this, and cash in this
Mastered this, flash this and make 'em clap to this
DJ's throw on cuts and obey the crowd
Just pump the volume up and play it loud
Hip-hop's embedded, before I said I wouldn't let it
But me and the microphone is still magnetic
Straight off the top, I knew I'd be forced to rock
Dance floors just stop, the spot's scorchin' hot
Hopin' I'll open Rakim Allah seminars
Massage at the bar, smokin' ten dollar cigars
While I admire MIDI, with more vision than TV's
I find it easy catchin' diabetes from fly sweeties
Sit back and wait to hear a slammin' track
Rockin' jams, by popular demand, I'm back

[Hook]
I control the crowd, you know Ra hold it down
When it drop, you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound
From town to town, until it's world-renowned
And I rock New York City all year around
You might also like[Verse 2]
It's on! So you can swerve when it's heard in clubs
Thought patterns displayed on Persian rugs
Equations are drawn up in paisley form
Mic, it stay warm, my flow is Evian
Deep as a Nautilus, you stay dipped in Ra's style
From the shores of Long Island to Panama Canal
Intellect pitches new trends like a clothes designer
I'm in effect, quicker than medicines in China
Split the mic open, fill it with somethin' potent to go in
And take a toke then mental planes start floatin'
Hot science is smokin', altitudes cause chokin'
Product is hypnotic, you're soakin' and still smokin'
Showin' better scenes than grams of amphetamines
Plans to scheme, means I'll forever fiend
Long as the mic is loud and the volume's pumpin'
I'mma move crowds to two-thousand and somethin'

[Hook]
I control the crowd, you know Ra hold it down
When it drop, you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound
From town to town, until it's world-renowned
And I rock New York City all year around

[Verse 3]
My rhymes and lyrics find spirits like a seance
Since fat crayons, I write and display chaos
My plan is damage, the diagram to where the jam is
I take advantage until the crowd go bananas
What a rush! I hear cuts and I lust to touch
Microphones be clutched by the illustrious
Word spread, I inherited many ways to say the unsaid
Born with three 7's in my head
In time, no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this
To find, you'll need philosophers and anthropologists
Astrologists, professors from your smartest colleges
With knowledge of scholarships, when Ra be droppin' this
Some of the things that I know will be in your next bible
When I die, go bury me and my notebook in Cairo
With the great God from Egypt, manifest, was writin' rhymes
Align with the stars, I come back to bless the mic
[Hook x2]
I control the crowd, you know Ra hold it down
When it drop, you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound
From town to town, until it's world-renowned
And I rock New York City all year around

[Outro]
Once again, back is the incredible
Word up, Rakim Allah the Microphone Fiend is back, yanahmean? (Rakim Allah!)
Til' death do us 'part, it's on
Once again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)
Once again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)

Let me tell ya

It's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell
What magic spells
We’ll be doing for us
And I’m giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can’t see
I can’t breathe
No more will we be

And nothing’s going to change the way we live
’Cause we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse, see
Whoa

And I just can’t see that half of us immersed in sin is all we have to give these

Well that’s what they said yesterday
There’s nothing left to do but pray
I think it’s time to find a new religion

Now the feds trying to throw they book at the crook
But I shook they worm and they hook
Guppies hold they breath. They want to miss me when I'm tipsy
Running everything west of the Mississippi
Its the unseen, pulling strings with my pinky ring
We got your woman, pucker up 'fore we fuck her up
Bow down before I make a phone call
Got 25 niggas running up on y'all
For the cheese we want them keys
Everybody freeze on your knees, butt naked please
Before any of you guppies get hard

Now who's dissin' the mad-ass Inglewood addition
I bust like a pimple, my mind is ill mental
The Westside connects with me and South Central
And a drag from the Zig Zag can't fuck with the Phillys
Holdin' down the wild west like a kid they call Billy
Once again it's Mack 10 the gold crown holda
Strong as a Coca-Cola with a chrome pistola (Brr!)
Now who wanna fuss so I can buss when I cuss
My look bring you fear with gear from the Surplus
Since a teen, I chased the green, the crack-scene king
Lolos, Corniches and baguettes on my pieces (Ugh)
So recognize these real Gs, chase the cheese
The Westside Connec' keep it rolling like gold D's
Three-wheeling and dealing, it's like the California style
But in the meanwhile, in my town, you got to bow
You might also like[Chorus: MACK 10]
(Bow down) When you come to my town
(Bow down) When I'm westward bound
(Bow down) Because I ain't a hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you

[Verse 3: W.C.]
Well it's that, Chuck-wearing, still sporting the beanie
The shadiest nigga in the clique, who want to see me?
As I slide my Locs on, let my khakis hang
Westside Connec' gang, Connec' gang, bing-bing bang (Westside!)
Run away, run away, or get your punk ass slayed
By this H double O to the D to the S.T.A. (Ahh!)
Fuck hiding it, I'm gang-related, simple and plain
Which means I could give a fuck
About you niggas in this rap game (Ugh!)
Flashy niggas get stuck up (Ugh!), beat the fuck up (Ugh!)
When you come around, keep your chain tucked from this...
Zero-zero-apostrophe S shit
Fuck a studio lyricist, I'm real with this (Yes!)
Talk the talk walk the walk
Diss me on wax?
I'm trying to saw your whole fucking head off, nigga
I'm platinum bound, so bitch, shut up
And nigga, all y'all could kiss my Converse like Sho Nuff
[Chorus: WC]
(Bow down) When I come to your town

Ha
Let me tell you something
Gangsta's make the world go round
So you ain't got to clown
But if you live on the west side of your town
Make them other fools bow down

The world belongs to us

Maybe one less time is all we need
I can't really help it if my tongue's all tied in knots
Jumping off a bridge, it's just the farthest that I've ever been
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
I know we're headed somewhere, I can see how far we've come
But still I can't remember anything
Let's not do the wrong thing and I'll swear it might be fun
It's a long way down when all the knots we've tied have come undone
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
How you gonna ever find your place
Running in an artificial pace?
Are they gonna find us lying face down in the sand?
So what the hell now, we've already been forever damned
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down

Cold Rock a Party,MC Lyte,Bad As I Wanna B,54,"8 ContributorsCold Rock a Party Lyrics[Intro]
(To the beat y'all! To the beat y'all! Just clap your hands, just clap your hands...)
To the L, to the Y and the T to the E
So get ready cause I want everybody to say this with me
(Rock the house, rock the house, rock the house)

[Hook]
Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

[Verse 1]
Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I get my bodyguard, You get that booty scarred
I'm a veteran, which means that I've been
In the game too long, since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I flow like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Spectacular over M-I-C
I go for broke, never giving it less than the best
Lots of years in the game at your request
You like the rhyme, bite if you dare
I get the paper so I don't care
Fly that's me; the epitomy
Of what a real MC is supposed to be
Fucking you up every time that I drop
I fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look, it ain't hard to tell that I

[Verse 2]
Back off me and let my skin breathe, Lyte is everlasting
It's hard to believe I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, Don't plan to get down
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun
If you don't understand then say you don't (nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best (say what?)
West to East, see East to West
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive
Cause it's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics
I got many witnesses that can back this
Ruffnecks, from New York to L.A
Been down with me since Poor George
It's '96 -- it's all about show and prove and I'm about to
Make the ill type moves, I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Get out my shit, please let me be
I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that
Trying to get over like a fat rat
But I understand I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop
It goes on, on, on, on
You see, the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver
Chilling with
A pina colada, kidada hooked me up
With Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere, that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit done
All on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you?
You better get down with your real crew
'Cause I ride the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

And in your eyes I see ribbons of color
I see us inside of each other
I feel my unconscious merge with yours
And I hear a voice say, ""What's his is hers""

[Chorus]
I'm falling into you (falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (falling into you)
Falling into you

[Verse 2]
I was afraid to let you in here
Now I have learned love can't be made in fear
You must begin to tumble down
And I can't even see the ground

[Chorus]
I'm falling into you (falling into you)
This dream could come true
And it feels so good (falling into you)
Falling into you
Falling like a leaf, falling like a star

I used to worry, Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Gettin' stressed makin' excess mess in darkness
No electricity, Something's all over me
Greasy insomnia, Please release me and let me dream of
Makin' mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearin' off tights with my teeth

But there's no release, No peace, I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, Open my eyes, Rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, Kept takin' sleepers..
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, The night, I write by candle-light I find insight
From the mental movement

Keep the beast in my nature under ceaseless attack.. I gets no sleep..

I can't get no sleep

I can't get no sleep

I need to sleep, I can't get no sleep..

See my girl, she shivers in her bones

No se le ha olvidado cómo la pasamos
Fuimos a la disco y los dos bailamos pegados
Como perros pegados, besos y un par de tragos
Se quedó a mi lado y dijo: ""Creo me he enamorado""
Ella fuma, ella toma
Es diablita, chiquita, pero picosa
Me encanta cuando el pantalón me lo roza
A ella le encanta, se ve en su cara lo goza

Le pones música y solita se excita
Pa' la fiesta nunca se limita

Pero tú, mamá, sabes, me mamas
Loca, ven pa'cá, pégate hasta atrás
Nos vamos tú y yo en un viaje fugaz
Interestelar, comerte toda
Fumaremos los dos marihuana
En el cuarto, en la azotea y en mi cama
Nena, creo te llaman, contesta mañana
Que no se apague la llama
En el AMG escuchando ""Ruedas y Cristal""
Quemando veneno que me trae volando, ma

ロマンチックな人生は諦めてたけど
周りはカップルばかりで
それを合図だと、受け止めるべきかな？
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

寂しいよ
私を抱きしめてくれる恋人はいないかな
部屋に閉じこもって泣いちゃうよ
恋愛のことは疑心暗鬼になってしまう
それでももっともっと求めたくなるの

キューピッドにセカンドチャンスをあげたのに
今ここにいるのは惨めな自分
その愛は本物じゃないってわからせたいのに
キューピッドは本当に馬鹿なんだね

迷子になったのか、どこかへ飛んでしまったのかな？
待ってはいられないよね

I don't wanna go
But baby, we both know
This is not our time
It's time to say goodbye
Until we meet again
'Cause this is not the end
It will come a day
When we will find our way

[Pre-Chorus]
Violins playing and the angels crying
When the stars align then I'll be there

[Chorus]
No, I don't care about them all
'Cause all I want is to be loved
And all I care about is you
You're stuck on me like a tattoo
No, I don't care about the pain
I'll walk through fire and through rain
Just to get closer to you
You're stuck on me like a tattoo

[Verse 2]
I'm letting my hair down
I'm taking it cool
You got my heart in your hand
Don't lose it, my friend
It's all that I got

[Verso 1: Peso Pluma & Natanael Cano]
Me levanto, un baño y luego me pongo a forjar
Es veneno, da pa' arriba, de muy buena calidad
Los teléfonos no paran nunca de sonar
Si no es alguna plebita, es porque un cliente quiere más

[Coro: Peso Pluma & Natanael Cano]
Y bien forrados los paquetes van
No hay pendiente, no puedo fallar
Siempre estoy listo para cruzar
Polvo, ruedas y también cristal
Aquí el papelito viene y va
Las morritas bien locas se van
Disfrutamos este bien o mal
De esta vida no me vo'a quejar

Qué detallazo pa' mensajear con la muerte
Una colt siete chinos que de retrato trae
Al señor de la montaña, de los drones y demás
Cuernos del diablo junto a mi seguridad
Viejo lobo en verguiza para el polvo traficar
Dios siempre me cuida y mi gorrita de Elegua

[Pre-Coro: Junior H & Peso Pluma]
En la sangre traigo el 701
Melena de león, pues vengo de uno
Siempre amafiado, pues no somos culos
Bajo perfil el chavalón y se le extraña
Aunque se fue, nunca se le olvida
Bélicos ya somos, bélicos morimos

A Dios le pido perdón por los pecados

[Intro: Yandel & Feid]
Déjate ver
Dime si hoy vas pa' la calle, bebé
'Toy en el case pensándote otra vez
Quiero pichear, pero me salió al revés
Mi amor, a las dos paso por ti, ve arreglándote
Hoy to' corre por la mía, relájate
Prometí que no iba a hacerte daño
Así me sienta' extraño, soy el que se quedó en tu piel

[Pre-Coro: Feid]
Y mientras (Y mientras) me calientas (Me calientas)
Veo todo lo quе nunca me cuentas (Me cuеntas)
El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas

[Coro: Yandel & Feid]
Dale hasta abajo que ese culo responde
Bebé, no te haga', tú eres under
Yo sé to' lo que tú esconde'
Tú y yo vamo' a hacer más de una noche
Y mientras (Y mientras) me calientas (Me calientas)
Veo todo lo que nunca me cuentas (Me cuentas)
El party es más cabrón si tú te sueltas

Vine a buscarte, tú sabes la intención
Perreamo' esta canción
Después me dice', ma, qué te pareció
Y yo no sé, pero me dio contigo
Estaba ruteando, pensándote y salí del caserío
Quiero probarte, que sea esta noche
Bebé, me traje la corta por si me meto en un lío

[Verso 2: Feid]
'Toy en el punto, bebé, pero estoy pendiente de ti
Los peine' están full, la moto full de gasoli
Gafitas Oakley, machea con la white tee
Me dice ""FERXXO"", qué rico se lo metí
Esa noche 'e jangueo, de fumeteo
Contigo to' los partie' son de perreo
Bebé, cuando te veo, yo te leo
Tú te pierde', mami, yo te rastreo, oh
Baby, me la paso joseando, no tengo de otra
Hagamo' que esta noche sea larga, bebé, porque la vida e' muy corta

Take a look inside your heart
Is there any room for me (Is there any room for me?)
I won't have to hold my breath
Till you get down on one knee (Till you get down on one knee)
Because you only want to hold me
When I'm looking good enough (When I'm looking good enough)
Did you ever feel me?
Would you ever picture us? (Would you ever picture us?)

[Verse 2: PinkPantheress]
Every time I pull my hair
Well, it's only out of fear (Only out of fear)
That you'll find me ugly
And one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying?
It was nеver even lovе (It was never even love)
Did you ever want me?
Was I ever good enough? (Ever good enough?)

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Like some kind of congressman?

Lo que un día soñé, todo ya me lo compré

Pura morrita bien buena, montada en mi camioneta

Destapando las champagne, hay billetes pa' gastar
Moviendo bien el ice, everywhere me han de mirar

[Verso 1]
Me enseñaste que el amor no es una estafa
Y que cuando es real no se acaba
Intenté que no me veas llorar
Que no veas mi fragilidad
Pero las cosas no son siempre como las soñamos
A veces corremos pero no llegamos
Nunca dudes que aquí voy a estar
Háblame, que te voy a escuchar, uh

Y aunque la vida me tratara así
Voy a ser fuerte solo para ti

Lo único que quiero es tu felicidad y еstar contigo
Una sonrisa tuya es mi debilidad
Querеrte sirve de anestesia al dolor
Hace que me sienta mejor
Para lo que necesites estoy
Viniste a completar lo que soy

[Verso 2]
Se nos rompió solo un plato, no toda la vajilla
Y aunque no sé poner la otra mejilla
Aprender a perdonar es de sabios
Que solo te salga amor de esos labios

It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde, fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?""
Got no alibi

[Pre-Chorus]
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

[Chorus]
Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast, burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?

For the love of my life
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin

I don't need no light to see you

[Chorus]

It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

Y cuando te necesitaba diste tu peor versión
Sorry, baby, hace rato

Yo contigo ya no regreso, ni que me llores ni me supliquе'
Entendí que no es culpa mía quе te critiquen
Yo solo hago música, perdón que te salpique
Me dejaste de vecina a la suegra
Con la prensa en la puerta y la deuda en Hacienda
Te creíste que me heriste y me volviste más dura

No sé ni qué es lo que te pasó
'Tás tan raro que ni te distingo
Yo valgo por dos de 22
Cambiaste un Ferrari por un Twingo
Cambiaste un Rolex por un Casio

Cuando por las noches recordaba todo
El olor de aquel perfume sobre todo
Las sábanas blancas donde te escondías dentro

Eres intocable como joya de oro
Esas piernas largas comerme yo solo
Y tus ojos grandes, me perdí en un laberinto

Y pensar
Que tú ya no vas a estar
Pasará
Solito me dejará
Intentar
Solo un beso y tú te vas
De mi vida, ah, ah
Como tú no hay nadie más
No hay nadie más

Ah
¿Y qué?

Si te sientes sola no me llames porfa
Me pongo sensible, me imagino tu sombra

But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright

Por la Zapata, el Gordo trae el mando
Tirando línea con Manny y el Caña
A la orden pa'l desorden conectado
Y mi RT en Acapulco
Y si hay pedo, los sepulto
Aquí no andamos haciendo bulto
Al chingazo yo resulto
Y una glockzona que va conmigo
Siempre lista para un susto

Y que sigan llegando las pacas

Puro Apaseo el Alto

Unas banquetearas a veces tomando
Y mi compa Power y también el Mau
Me hacen segunda, nunca me han dejado
Y mi compa Sapo, si hay pedo, él brinca

Y pa' qué les cuento si no tiene chiste
Yo soy el Gordo, para que se ubiquen
Y en una moto yo les caigo en quince

Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment
[Chorus 1]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

[Chorus 2]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!

Perdón, es que no sé la razón y metí el corazón en donde no debía

No me pidas disculpas que la culpa es mía

¿Por qué el que me tocó a mí es frágil?

[Uvod]
Mi bomo celo noč plesali
Ljubili se in se igrali
Kot da nas jutri več ne bo

[Kitica 1]
Vedno manj besed, tanek led pod nogami žge
Mi pa bežimo s prepiha
810.000 let moraš delat' le
Da duša malo zadiha

[Kitica 2]
(An ban, pet podgan) Ti loviš, če preživiš
(Jaz ti bom vzel vse) Ti ničesar ne dobiš
(A, a, a) Si tega res želiš?

[Pred-refren]
Igra sovraštva je za vas, hvala lepa
Ne računajte na nas, na nas

Mi bomo celo noč plesali (A-a)
Ljubili se in se igrali (A-a)

I've been far away, I'mma lumineer now, I make moves start waves
I've been dreaming about flying for a long time
I had a vision from the grey's they wanna co-sign
Artificially intelligent New-AI
I'm your future past and present, I'm the fine line

I don't need gravity, I just need growth, (woah)

And I don't need to be humble
Break down walls like Jericho crumble

Past the stratosphere, I can catch fire
I can go hard, I don't even need to try, yeah

Predestined written in stone
I feel it coming in, I feel it in my bones
Heavily protected never alone
Tapped in, I'm connected to the unknown, (woah, woah)

[Verso 1: Pedro Tovar & Peso Pluma]
Mi compa, ¿qué le parece esa morra?
La que anda bailando sola me gusta pa' mí
¡Bella! Ella sabe que está buena
Que todos andan mirándola cómo baila
Me acerco y le tiro todo un verbo
Tomamos tragos sin peros, solo tentación
Le dije: ""Voy a conquistar tu familia, que en unos días vas a ser mía""
Me dijo que estoy muy loco, pero le gusta
Que ningún vato como yo actúa

[Interludio: Pedro Tovar & Peso Pluma]
Y ahí te va, mija
Y pura Doble P, viejo
Así nomás, compa Pedro
Puro Eslabon Armado
Pa' las plebitas
¡Cha-chau!

[Verso 2: Peso Pluma & Pedro Tovar]
No soy un vato que tiene varo
Pero hablando del corazón te cumplo todo
Me agarró pegadito dе su mano
Mi compa ni se la creyó, que al pasar fui yo
Su cuеrpo, juro por Dios, que era tan perfecta
Su cinturita como modelo
Sus ojos desde el principio me enamoraron
A ella le gusto y a mí me gusta

Und Baby, wenn nur du

Wollte fliegen, leben, lachen, glaube, Schmerz gehört dazu
Mache Fehler, ja, ich weiß das, aber alles, was ich brauche und nie hatte, das bist du

Und Baby, ja, nur du kommst an mein Heart
Und Baby, ja, nur du bleibst lang bei mir

Und bin ich in Gedanken, bin ich bei dir
Jeder Schritt und jede Meile bring'n uns näher ans Ziel
Hätt ich gewusst, was passiert, wenn ich die Mische kippe
Hätte ich den Drink vor all den Jahr'n sicher niemals probiert, nah
Denken wird mir nachts zu sehr zu 'nem Verhängnis, ja
Ich sperr' mich selber ein, ich bau' mir ein Gefängnis, ja
Ich laufe tausend Kilometer im Kreis
Muss wohl ein'n Schritt zurück, um Sorgen aus dem Käfig zu befrei'n

But you can't break, a broken heart

And tear me up and move on to another

[Verse 1 : Rand Slam]
Semua bermula dari saat ku mulai
Tata rima dan urai makna hingga ku tuai
Sedikit hasil dan kasih, yang kasih sumbangsih
Ku fasih dan pasti nanti akan ku raih
Tiap cita dan cinta lewat tinta yakinkan
Bagai pita kaset jalan hidupku melingkar
Rekam jejakku saat masih di “Kata Pengantar”
Kini mengantarku ada di antara pelontar
Bertemu Bung Sutar, mahar rokok bungkusan
Nongkrong ke Tiben dan berbondong ketiban
Puluhan beat cantik untuk kami nikmati
Siap kami invasi dari bait ke bait
Dari hari ke hari ku tingkatkan intensitas
Perlihatkan atensi dalam tiap intensiku
Takkan berhenti tuk, belajar mengerti
Supaya ku seperti Doyz, terpandang di negeriku
Dan banyak energiku tuk balas mereka yang berjasa
Karena mereka yang pertama sempatkan waktu
Dengarkan
Sepatah kataku takkan mampu tuk ungkapkan
Biar senartogok ambil alih temani dia bernyanyi

Maka di (sela-sa)yup jiwa berdegup kematian menatap

Dan estetika terlihat santun, bak pemadat di penjuru
Hasrat tak ubahnya kembar siam siap tumbuh
Pada tanah keinginan, antara pilu dan peluh
Musik memaksaku, jadi pendengar lalu angkat

Buku mengajak pena mengisi nasib agar tak monoton
Melahap seminggu penuh, ketika imajinasi mulai kita
Rengkuh

To get back on track
Tearing down the walls
Slowly every step
Now I see myself
Building up a world of bridges

[Verse 2]
There is one more thing
You need to know
That I forgive myself for all the lies I said bеfore
Now I see the road
Of leading lights
Showing mе where I should go and what to leave behind, a-ah

[Chorus]
There is always time
To get back on track
Tearing down the walls
Slowly every step
Now I see myself
Building up a world of bridges
You will find a way
To begin again
No more time to waste
Or to play pretend
Now I see myself
Building up a world of bridges

All the lies and blurry lines and city lights I knew
Now I'm strong enough to see what lays inside
And I can feel it all

Tearing down the walls
Slowly every step

Building up a world of bridges

Don't wanna forget, am I dreaming yet?

Seven minutes of unnecessary panic attacks
Here I go with the coldest hands
Here I go with still no plans, oh, still no plans

Bebí, fumé, me enamoré
Metí la pata, metí el pie
Me di dos palos, medité
Me di el abrazo y el café

Me dio un dolor de no sé qué
Busque la causa en internet
Dice que voy a morirme de algo
Y que no es de la risa

Cuando me vaya que no me lloren
Compren vino, no quiero flores
Con to lo caminao, a mí no me han contao
Yo me merezco la siesta
Y a mis amigos que no me lloren

Compren vino, no traigan flores
Si me voy a morir solamente una vez
Me merezco la fiesta
Yo me merezco la fiesta

Se fue el tren
Varios tropiezos en el camino
Pero me fue bien
Viví, cumplí con mi destino
Fui lo que soñé
No me despido mis amigos, yo vuelvo otra vez

Gladiator,Jann,Gladiator,75,"9 ContributorsGladiator Lyrics[Verse 1]
Welcome to the party, say hi to everybody
Paid for by Martini but they're sippin' on Bacardi
Body's more than just a flesh, you can sell it for success
What's your price, what's your address?
We can finish at my place
Ever been to Bali? I really need some sun
Such a shame 'bout that tsunami, I'll have to go to Cali
I can get you dressed, wrap your body in excess
Give them something to obsess over

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll love it when I
Give it to you, leave you wanting more
I know your addiction's attention
Let's start a show
Is it everything and more than you were hoping for?
Show us something we ain't never seen before

[Chorus]
Smash your competition, baby
Show us some good entertainment
Victory's your only payment
Gladiator, gladiator

[Verse 2]
Welcome to the party, I know it's kinda funny
That everyone is acting like they know you personally
Just play along, be nice and all
You won't get far being on your own
They've all been dying for a little drama
Their favourite stars getting out of coma
To fill the news with 90s nostalgia
It will take more than just a pretty face to top that

Give it to you, leave you wanting more

Is it everything and more than you were hoping for?
Now show us something we ain't never seen before

Smash your competition, baby
Show us some good entertainment
Victory's your only payment

Fake it 'til you make it
Mask on, never take it off
Wear it 'til wearing it feels natural
Whatever you tell yourself it's not true
Power's what I make it

I'm picking your new favourite
You buy it and I savour it
You buy it and I savour it
You buy it and I savour it

Di depan mereka
Tuhan masih pantaskah ku ‘tuk bersamanya

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady, you a basehead"" (Uh-uh)
""Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted""
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; ""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg""

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole""

Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

There you go

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)
[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!
[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet230Embed",748,7BMO7O7ImjV8HNTH74Tshv,"{'danceability': 0.908, 'energy': 0.758, 'key': 9, 'loudness': -4.753, 'mode': 0, 'speechiness': 0.174, 'acousticness': 0.0687, 'instrumentalness': 0, 'liveness': 0.0783, 'valence': 0.87, 'tempo': 148.015, 'type': 'audio_features', 'id': '7BMO7O7ImjV8HNTH74Tshv', 'uri': 'spotify:track:7BMO7O7ImjV8HNTH74Tshv', 'track_href': 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/7BMO7O7ImjV8HNTH74Tshv', 'analysis_url': 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/7BMO7O7ImjV8HNTH74Tshv', 'duration_ms': 297840, 'time_signature': 4}",0.908,0.758,-4.753,0.174,0.0687,0.0,0.0783,0.87,148.015,297840,
Not Afraid,Eminem,Recovery,82,"348 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsItalianoΕλληνικάFrançaisNot Afraid Lyrics[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
Yeah
To take a stand (To take a stand)
It's been a ride
Everybody (Everybody)
I guess I had to
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
Go to that place to get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Might still be in that place
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
If you're tryna get out
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Just follow me, I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's
Still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow!
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out
But I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone

The Way I Am,Eminem,The Marshall Mathers LP,76,"284 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishEnglishРусскийThe Way I Am Lyrics[Segue from ""Steve Berman (Skit)""]
...Man, whatever

[Intro]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone
Fuck it, just shut up and listen
Ayo
[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (You ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me
You might also like[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Ha, radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Ha, I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? (Parents at?) And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned
[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Ha, I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be Black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where, and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad
[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Ha, I don't know, that's just the way I am

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—
[Chorus: Rihanna & Eminem]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie

Yeah
You know, I've been around for a while now
Not sure if I have much left to prove
Yeah I do, haha

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I look at me now, I'm thinkin', ""Damn""
How proud of me I am
What I did is nothin' to sneeze at
Even if your allergies are bad
I'm up in a balcony in France
I look around, I see the fans
How they surround me in the stands
Probably could drown in a sea of hands
They're hollerin', ""Shady"" (""Shady"")
Yelling it out to me and that's what I mean when I say
That one day someway, somehow, if I get the chance to get a crowd
I'd flip it around and have a crowd give me the chants
(I've done it all, man)
But in actuality, I haven't, yet

[Chorus: Sly Pyper & Eminem, Sly Pyper]
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)
I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (My only question is)
Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey
Really I have no idea (All I know is, all)
All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling (Yeah, oh)

Got no time for no haters in this bitch
Or toleration for this shit
But like medication, my dedication
And the time it takes to do this shit
Reminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waiting room'll get
What I mean is maybe I have more patience (patients) than I'm able to admit
Yeah, but I'm still mentally stable as a three-legged table in this bitch
Fame was a switch, but I was grateful to trade this shit for the trailer with a hitch
That it would make me a raving lunatic
But I made it through my situation, I hit pay dirt
Now I get paper like a stapler in this bitch
But just 'cause I made a little bit of change
Don't mean I've changed a little bit
Brain full of wit, dangerous, can't extinguish this English language when it's lit
And I'm just berating you with it, it's Shady 'til I'm eighty-two
I'll spit this crazy, even Dre, he knows (nose) I'ma blow
Better get the handkerchief again, haha

Oh, now what am I gonna do?
Can't nothing hold me, I'm on the loose
Born a winner, damn, it's so hard to lose
I can do it even when I'm tryin' to
When my record flops, it still go through the roof
This atmosphere's for a chosen few
Who was on they grind makin' money moves
And you ain't gon' get there if you watered-down
You gotta take shots with a hundred proof (Check it out)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Been in survival mode
Since a five year old, it was I alone
Since my trike was stole, spiral notebook and microphone
But lookin' back how bad it was then
If it hadn't been for the pad and the pen
Addict mom and deadbeat dad
I wouldn't have had the savage within
Havin' to win every single battle I'm in
All I ever wanted was to be an emcee
Tediously I wrote obediently, believing in me
EPMD must've had teachin' degrees
Learned to defeat enemies with the ink, thinkin' of these rhymes
Would be as Eazy as E
And graffiti would be like remedial readin' to me (Yeah)
'Til my last breath leaves my lungs
I'ma beat my drum (Yeah) for the streets I'm from (Yeah)
The East side slums (Yeah), gotta remind 'em (Yeah)
I'll take a foe out (Yeah), like fee-fi-fum
You see my finger (What?), you see my thumb (What?)
You see my fist, fuck a peace pipe, I'm (What?)
Here for the smoke but it's not the weed I want (What?)
With this beat I brung for the beef I've come (Woo)
But you better bring it if you wanna reply from
'Cause for you to be lyrically inclined, it'd be a steep climb up
That'll be an uphill battle
But I'm up like your feet in a recliner
And I think I'm about to go out on a limb like a tree climber
Time to push my ceiling higher 'cause

Where am I supposed to go from here? (Woah-oh-oh) Hey

Venom - Music From The Motion Picture,Eminem,Kamikaze,76,"2 ContributorsVenom-Music from the motion picture LyricsI got a song filled with shit for the strong willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Set you off till you
Scream, piss off, screw you
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When's something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like

Knock knock, let the devil in, malevolent
As I've ever been, head is spinning and this medicine
Screaming, ""L-l-l-let us in""
L-l-lick like a salad bowl, Edgar Allen Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatin, think my skeleton's melting
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure
Element glue, screw it, to hell with it
I went through hell with accelerance and blew up
My-my-myself again, Volkswagen, tailspin
Bucket matches my pale skin, metal in
Went from Hellmann's and being rail thin, Filet-o-Fish
Scribbles and Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on floor in the, motel then
Dr. Dre said: Hell yeah
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate but I don't care, I
Barely could wait to hit them with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my
Venom
(I got that) Adrenaline momentum (venom)
Not knowing with 'em
Never gonna slow up in 'em
Ready to snap any moment-um
Thinking it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pin
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
I-i-it's evident I'm not done
V-venomous, the thought spun like your web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or a mud flap
Be strangled or attacked
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck a blood track
Like, what's her name at the wheel?
Danica Patrick
Through the car into reverse at the end of the nut ration
And you look back and it's just mangled steel
My Mustang and Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed
Much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be the combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi
Translation, I will probably kill us both when I end up
Back in India
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happened
End of ya, when you're bit with the
Venom

I said, ""Knock knock, let the devil in, alien""
E-E-Elliot phone home, ain't no telling when this choke hold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're stepping in with my
Venom
Put the ballpoint pen 'em
Gun cock, bump stock, devil eye, buckshot
Tied for the uppercut
Tie a couple knots, fired up and caught
Fire juggernaut
Punk rock bitches going down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not?
You only get one shot
Ate shit till I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner then drank till I faint
And I wait with a headache and I take anything in
Rectangular shape, then I wait
To face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasing me but I'm part of you
So escaping me is impossible
I latch onto you like a
Parasite, and I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the supervillain dad and mom was losing their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me

Without Me,Eminem,The Eminem Show,90,"439 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolTürkçePortuguês日本語Italianoहिन्दीDeutschFrançaisفارسیDanskWithout Me Lyrics[Intro: Obie Trice]
Obie Trice, real name, no gimmicks *record scratch*

[Refrain 1: Eminem]
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
(Woo!) (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Refrain 2: Eminem]
Guess who's back? Back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more; they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me, so
Come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits, and get ready
'Cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!
You might also like[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves, a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter, I'm interesting
The best thing since wrestling, infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents; my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talking ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me; you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
You might also like[Chorus 1]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment
[Chorus 1]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

[Chorus 2]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!

When I'm Gone,Eminem,When I'm Gone,65,"287 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoTürkçePortuguêsDeutschAzərbaycanca / آذربايجانWhen I’m Gone Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya!""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause, man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late.""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and ""Thank you all for comin' out""
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
""But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?""
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
""But baby, wait!"" – ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

Sing For The Moment,Eminem,The Eminem Show,80,"338 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEnglishItalianoहिन्दीEnglishAzərbaycanca / آذربايجانSing for the Moment Lyrics[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, so we can—
[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream:
""Dre, don't leave us like that, man"", 'cause—

No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all!
If y'all don't like me, blow me!
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me and turn me back to the old me

So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him, Hailie (Dada?)

If it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop
Comin' up to me with your hands out
Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you weren't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, 'cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch

Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down...

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it
My crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy somethin' I helped build?
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, 'cause—

There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated—it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we've just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience
'Cause—

Bumpin' and grindin' that pole

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk
Get fucked up, hit the strip club
Don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed, get fucked
Get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it

Who can catch lightning in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on a fire hose, flyer than swatters?

Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start to bug, prick, you better flee, 'cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you're tricked
It's a trap, fuck my last CD, the shit's in my trash
I'll be goddamned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes
And keep winkin' and blowin' kisses 'cause you're flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin', no remorse I'm showin', ain't slowin'
For no one, knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it
Zero in on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid, saliva—what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up, stand behind you like, ""Woo!""
That boy's hot enough to melt Hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
So you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly, he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how 'bout you?

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop, pajama time

[Verse 1]
Come here, little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot-poot, it's okay

Let the top down and my hair blow

When I get there someone's gonna touch my body

'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me? Maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—
[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MCs, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket

We touch, I feel a rush
We clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous
You must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible, gained my trust
Don't play games, it'll be dangerous if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil, spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold
Walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin' to start over
I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster
Somethin' I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasn't jokin' when I told you you take my breath away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'll do whatever it takes
When I'm with you, I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's gonna be that one?
And then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake 'cause I'm a

Right at you
[Verse 3: Eminem]
So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you, squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks, now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

[Bridge: Eminem]
And I woulda done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a

Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady! (Let's go!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Eminem]
Okay, let's go!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit (Uh huh)

Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
""Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!""
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can, Ken, don't ask me this again

Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!

Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention

What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes, the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, I'm still wit' you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you, and that's just being real wit' you
You see, the truth is, everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then, I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claimin' they nonviolent, talkin' like they— (Do not resist the beat)
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit, and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name out of your mouth, and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!)
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid—never come down!
Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold your breath 'til ain't none left
Yo, that's the difference!
[Chorus: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'
[Verse 3: Eminem | Dr. Dre]
A'ight, hold up, hold up!
Stop the beat a minute! I got somethin' to say, Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me (What the fuck?)
I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back (Right), just know this shit
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga, let's blow this bitch
I mean it, dog—you ever need somebody offed: ""Whose throat is it?""
Well, if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's mama
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people (Hi!)
Then drop her off on the corner at the police station
And drive off, honkin' the horn for her (*Beep-beep!*)
Raw-dog, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed-off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus and hot water
That's for tryna talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
And you better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, ""I just don't give a fuck!"" and see who means it
[Chorus: Phish]
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'

White America,Eminem,The Eminem Show,69,"250 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeItalianoहिन्दीWhite America Lyrics[Intro]
America! Ha ha ha! We love you
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars
For the rights that men have died for to protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold… or so we're told
(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)

[Verse 1]
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on

White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Verse 2]
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby (Ooh, baby!) — Look at my sales!
Let's do the math: If I was black, I would've sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic! Show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
""Fuck it,"" until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was prob'ly his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped: sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's—
[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Verse 3]
See, the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms prob'ly would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too, because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like, ""I don't like this note!""
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say ""faggot"", shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The poster child, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for—
[Chorus]
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! Little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

[Outro]
So to the parents of America, I am the Derringer
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the *galf*​​ and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you, Ms. Cheney! Fuck you, Tipper Gore!
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have! Fuck you!
Ha ha ha, I'm just playin', America

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 1]
The way she moves, she's like a belly dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door, but I don't think I'ma answer
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze?
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs
I'm not done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer, I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B
I sing song, it go ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
If I offend, I'm sorry, please, please, forgive
For I am Triumph the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet

Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums

What do you mean, freeze? Geez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theater, please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great, big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh 'cause there's a puppet on my hand (Hahaha)
[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go

Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year, I'll say ""ass"" and she'll make my pee-pee go

[Verse 3]
The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, ""Get out, you bozo""
I need a new boyfriend, hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze? My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word ""pee-pee""
Pee, on the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down
[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me, please?
I ain't never seen an ass like that
'Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go

Tell me where to go
Tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say
No matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid
That would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
‘Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often
Flyin' off at the handle at my mom
No dad, so I am noncompliant at home
At school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems
Thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalkin' up drawings
On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
To myself, either that or inside hidin' off in
The corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to
Be noticed ‘cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
‘Cause he said that I eye-balled him

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
‘Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'
‘Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit
Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I don’t give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit, look on the bright side, at least I ain't walkin'
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'?
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him
Grab hold of my balls, like, ""That's right, fight's on, bitch!""
Who woulda knew, from the moment I turned the mic on, that
I could be iconic in my conquest?
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest

It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
‘Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
‘Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
Now you shut up, bitch, I am talkin'
Thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins

Recovery brought me nothin' but back
To right where I was and perhaps
This coulda been my victory lap, if I wasn't on the verge of relapse

It seems to be the reoccurring main theme
The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen
I went from an irate teenager to still raging
As adult, amazing: back then I put anything
Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it! …Did what?
Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating
Shady and entertaining from real life
But this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain
It's the craziest shit I
Ever seen, and back then it was like I ain't even
Bothered taking into consideration
You one day being older and may hear me say things
I didn’t (A) mean and (B) just ain’t me
Okay, so ladies and gentlemen
Let's strip away everything and see the main reason that I
Feel like a lame piece of shit, I sound cranky and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things
'Cause when I look at me, I don't see what they see
I feel ashamed, greedy
And lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy, what's in my—

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of What'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause—

I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, zero to sixty, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?

(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!

When me and Fif' got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped
We just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, mi nemesis es su nemesis
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl
And we all get involved in it
And we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin'
The most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight, we ain't come in here to beef with nobody
We came to party: Banks, Ca$his, and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady, Aftermizath, back in that ass, you izzask?
Come izzon, what kinda fizzuckin' quizzestion is that?

Slumped over bleedin'; J.F.K

I thrive off of danger, jumpin' in all beef

Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine

Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin' G?
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all-way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?

I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, ma'fucker
‘Cause all this bullshit just made me strong, ma'fucker

So I pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head

And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

Uh
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I, I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise

It hurts, but I never show

If only you could see just how lonely and how cold

When push come to shove I just stand up and scream: ""Fuck 'em all!""

Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
Oops, time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim, but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another, I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life
Too late
(Yeah, I can't keep chasing you
I'm taking my life back)
Caught in a chase, twenty-five to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life, I woulda laid
Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain
Bitch, you took me for granted
Took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
Now my respect, I demand it
I'ma take control of this relationship, command it
And I'ma be the boss of you now, goddamn it
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid?
Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothin' left
But you keep treatin' me like a staircase: it's time to fuckin' step
And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in-depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left, I laughed while you wept
How's it feel now? Yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor though, my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate, but it's—

I feel like when I bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh
'Cause that ain't good enough
You expect me to fold myself in half till I snap
Don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side? I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time? You don't think so, do you?
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you still?
Man, I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you – go marry someone else and make 'em famous!
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat
I'm moving on, forget you
Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this
So many times it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep askin' me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama, I'm drawn to
Shit, I guess I'm a mess, cursed and blessed, but this time I
Ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss
You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you, hip hop! I'm leavin' you, my life sentence is served, bitch
And it's just—

Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check, one-two, we recordin'?

[Verse 1]
I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fuckin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out, I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out (C'mere) his blond dreads (Fuck you)
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco

I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt

That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer

With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it

I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I've been with ten women who got HIV
Now, don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree

Yeah, what up, Detroit?
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh, no, he didn't (Ah)
They didn't do it again (What-what, you what?)
You shitted on these niggas two times, Dr. Dre?
Oh, fo' sho'
Uh-uh, naw, you smell that?
This is special right here (What-what, what-what-what?)
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie, baby, uh
To the boogie-oogie-oogie
Yeah, ya know, what's crackin', Dre?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
Just let me lay back and kick some old simplistic pimp shit on Slim's shit
And start riots like Limp Bizkit
Best throw on ""Guilty Conscience"" at concerts
And watch mosh pits 'til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
(Watch out, nigga!)
Some of these crowds that Slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw IS niggas from Crenshaw
From Long Beach to South Central
Whoa! Not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again (Shit!)
You and what army could harm me?
D.R.E. and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach (Westside)
Came a long way to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long Uz' and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare just bein' Andre
But I…

Hello, nigga! You know about Dogg-ay (Snoop Dogg)
And let me cut these niggas up and show 'em where the fuck I'm comin' from

Hit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run (Watch out)
Got about fifty guns and I love
All of 'em the same, bang-bang (Word up)
Damn, baby girl, what's your name? (What's your name?)
I forgot, what'd you say it was? Damn, a nigga buzzed (Fucked up)
Hangin' in the club with my nephew Eminem (What's up, Slim?) What up, Cuz? (What up, Snoop?)
The Great White American Hope (Uh-huh)
Done hooked up with the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast, baby

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the façade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a 12 gauge about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough, I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees

Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right to say what I like
And walk around flippin' the bird?
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
That somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here:
I start some trouble everywhere that I go (That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know ('Cause they know)
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door (The back door)
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44 (A .44)

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down

Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling-bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown
When child support knocked, ""No, he's not around""
Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
'Cause see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Haha)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo

By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
Durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me
I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan, my pops left me
And often my mama wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky

No lie, just know I chose my own fate

See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' ""Dixie""
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer

Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Damn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre, Eminem, & (Eddie)]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this shit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)

Meet Stan, 21 years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest

After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man

Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?

My heart got calloused
I don't make that excuse
It's hard but you're worth it

You see all the wreckage
And it wrecks me that you stay

When I get lost in my own head
You always tell me the truth
And girl, you find me right where I am

Telling myself I won't go there
Oh, but I know that I won't care
Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt
This lust is a burden that we both share
Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer
Souls tied, intertwined by pride and guilt

From the way that I've been livin'
(Ooh) But I know I can't resist it

[Chorus]
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from thе daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hatе it at the same time

Tellin' myself it's the last time
Can you spare any mercy that you might find
If I'm down on my knees again?
Deep down, way down, Lord, I try
Try to follow your light, but it's nighttime

Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine
I think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway
It's been forever, but I'm feelin' alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day

[Verse 1]
Hide and seek, I am somewhere closed away
You won't believe how long it's been since I started the game
I can't be seen and you won't find me today
I've not been this low, but I'll be okay

[Pre-Chorus]
""Are you alright?"" Maybe don't ask
'Cause you know I never like to talk about that
Keep it inside, yeah, you say I always hold back
And I always wear long sleeves
Is it in your childhood? Somethin' happen in your past?
Well, the sadness, yeah, I promise that it won't last
And if I could, I would try to take it all back
There's still more underneath and that's when you say to me

[Chorus]
""Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine

Try to breathe, see a message and don't reply

But on some days, I feel like I'm trapped in a hole
But I keep quiet, so the ones around me don't know
That the mountain feels so steep
And I'll say that I'm here to help to carry the load
And the outside rays, they are good for the soul
So, let's step out of the dark 'cause, in here, it's so cold
The day's not out of reach and that's when you say to me

I miss knowing what you're thinking
And hearing how your day has been
Do you think you could tell me everything, darling?
But leave out every part about him
Right now, you're probably by the ocean
While I'm still out here in the rain
With every day that passes by since we've spoken
It's like Glasgow gets farther from LA

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe it's supposed to be this way

[Chorus]
But, oh, my love
I wanna say, ""I miss the green in your eyes""
And when I said we could be friends, guess I lied
I wanna say, ""I wish that you never left""
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best
I wanna say, ""Without you, everything's wrong""
And you were everything I need all along
I wanna say, ""I wish that you never left""
Oh, but instead, I only wish you the best

[Verse 2]
Well, I can't help but notice
You seem happier than ever now
And I guess that I should tell you I'm sorry
It seems I was the problem somehow

Fast Car,Luke Combs,Gettin' Old,89,"5 ContributorsFast Car Lyrics[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising and entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
Said I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder

Why I keep
Obsessing on and stressin' all the little things

No excuse to give You, it's true
Hanging by a thread's how I live
I don't know why, but I feel more comfortable

To pick me up and pull me out this hole I'm trapped in

I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself?
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else

[Pre-Chorus]
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel thе lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alonе

[Chorus]
Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my

Delusion is here again
And I think you'll come home soon
A word brings me right back in
Then it's only me that's in this room
I guess I could just pretend
The colours are more than blue
But I lost more than my friend
I can't help but missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I pictured this month a little bit different, no one is ever ready
And when it unfolds, you get in a hole, oh, how can it be this heavy?
Everything changes, nothing's the same, except the truth is now you're gone
And life just goes on

This world is spinnin' so fast
My world is spinnin' so slowly
I'm holdin' on to the past
I'm living deep in the lonely
I let myself slip away
I let the midnights control me

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what else to do
I'm writing this song to get over you

[Chorus]
But every word keeps me up at night
Every chord leaves me paralyzed
Every melody's just reminding me I need you tonight
Tears are fallin' on the ebonies
There's only silence where you're meant to be
Singin' out of key's just reminding me I'm broken insidе
What hurts even more
Is I'll always bе yours but you'll never be mine

[Verse 2]
This world keeps spinnin' so fast
But my world is crumblin' before me
Still hear your voice in my head
And I can't pretend to ignore it
I'd pay to make it all stop
But I'd sell my soul to afford it

Can't you just make it move faster?
Lovely to be sitting here with you
You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short

Then you're driving me home
And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
Before

Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos

But it's over
Then you're driving me home
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go

A couple kids waitin' on the sun

We were a few beers shy of freedom
I had my hands around your waist

You swear that you're stayin' single, next thing you know
You meet a girl at a bar and next thing you know
You get her laughin', it's 2AM
You're tellin' your buddies, three months in
That she ain't movin' in, the next thing you know
There's a U-Haul trailer, the next thing you know
Your old apartment, is y'all's new place
There goes the carpet but the deer head stays

[Chorus]
Next thing you know
You're savin' money like never before, just to
Spend it all at a jewelry store
Gettin' down on one knee on hеr mama's porch
Just prayin' she don't say, ""No""
Next thing you know
Your best man givеs a half-drunk speech and you're
Sunburnt on a honeymoon beach and your
Left hand's gettin' used to that ring
And there the next two or three years go
Next thing you know

[Verse 2]
You weren't really tryin', next thing you know
There's a test on the counter, next thing you know
She's standin' there cryin', noddin' her head yes
You're half excited, half scared to death

'Cause next thing you know
You're wearin' scrubs and a funny white hat and the
Doctor's sayin', how you doin' there dad and
Nobody's ever called you that
And you take that drive home slow
Next thing you know
It's first steps, first dates, first car
It's 11:01 wonderin' where they are
You're sayin' that USC's too far
It's amazing how fast seventeen years go
Next thing you know
Next thing you know

[Bridge]
Next thing you know
You get to know your wife again and you're
More in love than you've ever been
With a lot of years of remember when's and still some down the road

[Chorus]
'Cause next thing you know
You got a yard full of your kid's kids
And you take 'em to church, teach 'em to fish
And you, tell 'em stories every chance you get
About how fast this life down here can go

Well, I go to work every Monday
Get to do something I love
And I make it home every evening
To an angel God sent from above
Got an eight point on camera from last year
That this season looks like a ten
I got a barn with a fridge full of cold beer
On the weekend it's full of good friends

[Chorus]
I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees, thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
How'd a guy like me, who'd have been fine with three
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?

[Verse 2]
I got a half ton that's parked in the driveway
My dog wags his tail when he hears
I grew up in a good place to be from
My folks still got a bunch of good years

[Chorus]
Now I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees, thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over

Could you tell where my head was at when you found me?
Me and you went to hell and back just to find peace
Man, I thought I had everything, I was lonely
Now you're my everything, I was lonely

[Verse 1]
I mixed a lot of love with a lot of drugs, then I found you
She liked petty crimes, she had green eyes like Mountain Dew
And where she go, I'll never know, her friends bounced too
I guess it's their loss 'cause they'll never know what we'll amount to
Would you be my light, be my yellow?
P.Y.T. walking down Portobello
Put a smile on this face at the end of the day
MDMA helped us fly away
Who'd have known, who'd have known you would save my life?
Who'd have known, who'd have known you would fly my kite?
Could you tell, could you tell?
Could you tell, could you tell?

I sat down on a barstool, like a dern fool
'Cause she walked out again

Have been in your boots, my friend
Opened up back in '85
Got me over my first wife
Been stayin' busy since the first night""
It's a story old as time

God made the world in seven short days
He said it was good, I bet it was great
Then God made a man, and man got lonely
He said, ""Please, Lord, if I could only
Have an angel to hold in my arms""
So God made a girl, His best work of art
Oh, but He didn't make no place to go when she breaks your hеart
So man made a bar

I’ll be lovin’ you, no matter where I roam
I’ll be lovin’ you, you’re at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night, when the sky is crystal blue
I’ll do the only thing I know to do, I’ll be lovin’ you

[Refrain]
I’ll be lovin’ you

[Verse 2]
Tried to find it in thе roses, in the snow
Tried to climb it, hit a Rocky Mountain low
I couldn’t hidе it, like the bottle in my boot
When I’m deep in the dark and I look in my heart
And I’m looking for something true

[Chorus]
I’ll be lovin’ you, no matter where I roam
I’ll be lovin’ you, you’re at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night, when the sky is crystal blue
I’ll do the only thing I know to do, I’ll be lovin’ you

And the nights with the man in the moon
You’ll always belong at the end of my song
Even if I’m out of tune

I’ll be lovin’ you, you’re at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night, when the sky is crystal blue

Coyotes on my left and wolves on my right
Sun keeps shinin' in the middle of the night
Urban feels suburban, Main Street ain't main, yeah

A Lincoln came and a Jefferson went
Money on a Maytag and the thing won't spin
Couple hundred dollars feels more like change, yeah
And times like these make me feel strange

Pick a string, sing the blues, dancе a hole in your shoes

'Cause I could be at yours on Friday
Tonight's at the place we started
It's a long way back from ""sorry"", but here I go
How does it feel? How does it feel? (Just tell me somethin')

[Verse 1]
I don't know what to tell you, I don't know what to say
I got into my head, I'm sorry I threw it away
But I'm so glad you came back even through all the pain
Let me try and mend it, I can promise, I swear that I've changed

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, let me give you all of me
Can we just sort it out for real?

'Cause I could be at yours on Friday

Walk away, then, we hit rewind

Don't know what keeps keepin' it up

Is it your heart or mine?
Is it whiskey or wine?
Is it somethin' in the night
Makin' us wanna cross that line?

It's just a matter of time
'Til it finds your heart or mine

We say that it ain't no thing
We say it, then, the telephone rings
A hello, arе you at home
'Cause I'm all alone missin' you
Wе swear it ain't love, love, love
But you're there when the sun comes up
We swear it ain't love, love, love
But it always comes back to us

When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the mornin' with someone
But feelin' alone

[Refrain]
A heart is drawn around your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine
Sneakin' out into town
Holdin' hands, just killin' time

[Pre-Chorus]
Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you
The way you call me ""baby""
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is

[Chorus]
All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

Breakin' up, makin' up
Leave without sayin' goodbye (Ooh)

Now I call you ""baby""
It's why you're so amazing

I hate you met the sinner
Lord knows I ain't no saint
But I'm trying to lean a little more that way these days
You put up with more than I ever would've
And you left just like you should've
But since you've been gone
Ain't nothing 'round here the same

[Chorus]
'Cause girl, I've given up on
Drinking as much as I used to when I had you
Given up on, just sayin' I'm gonna change
I've given up on passing the blame
Everything made you walk out on what we had
But when it comes to wanting you back
I ain't ever giving up on that

[Verse 2]
I pray it ain't too late
For you to see what I've turned into
I just wish my working on me was working on you
But since you said goodbye
And hit me with them taillights
I swear I've changed everything, but your mind

Still got your number, but I don't call it
I'm still in pieces and it would be worse if we were talking
'Cause it feels like you're still stuck inside my heart
So how are you completely so together while I completely fall apart?

I wish I was doing okay, but there's no way I can pretend

They say there will come a day when this pain will leave my chest
But I'm not all the way over you yet

Time heals, but it'll feel like slow motion
It's like I'm tryna move on, but I'm frozen

How do you keep moving forward while I'm grinding to a stop?

We've been burnin' both ends
Keepin' the lights on
So I've been thinkin' we need
A little time alone

[Pre-Chorus]
So what you say we cancel our plans?
Tonight I'm only gonna be your man

Let's get some candles burning
And some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make

ロマンチックな人生は諦めてたけど
周りはカップルばかりで
それを合図だと、受け止めるべきかな？
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

[Pre-Chorus: Sio, All]
寂しいよ
私を抱きしめてくれる恋人はいないかな
部屋に閉じこもって泣いちゃうよ
恋愛のことは疑心暗鬼になってしまう
それでももっともっと求めたくなるの

キューピッドにセカンドチャンスをあげたのに
今ここにいるのは惨めな自分
その愛は本物じゃないってわからせたいのに
キューピッドは本当に馬鹿なんだね

迷子になったのか、どこかへ飛んでしまったのかな？
待ってはいられないよね
11月から待ち続けてたけど

[Intro: KAROL G]
La que te dijo que un vacío se llena con otra persona te miente
E' como tapar una herida con maquillaje: no se ve, pero se siente
Te fuiste diciendo que me superaste (Ey) y te conseguiste nueva novia (Novia)
Lo que ella no sabe es que tú todavía (Auh) me está' viendo to'a' la historia' (Papi)

[Coro: KAROL G]
Bebé, ¿qué fue?, ¿no pues que muy tragaíto'? (-íto')
¿Qué hace' buscándome el la'o? Si sabes que yo errore' no repito (Eh, papi)
Dile a tu nueva bebé que por hombre' no compito
Que deje de estar tirando, que al meno' yo te tenía bonito

[Verso 1: Shakira]
Verte con la nueva me dolió (Dolió)
Pero ya estoy puesta pa' lo mío
Lo que vivimos se me olvidó
Y eso e' lo que te tiene ofendido
Que hasta la vida me mejoró
Por acá ya no eres bienvenido
Vi lo que tu novia me tiró
Eso no da ni rabia, yo me río, yo me río

[Verso 2: KAROL G & Shakira]
No tengo tiempo pa' lo que no aporte, ya cambié mi norte
Haciendo dinero como deporte
Llenando la cuenta, los show', el parking y el pasaporte (Ey)
'Toy más dura dicen lo' reporte' (Sí)
Ahora tú quiere' volver, se te nota, mmm, sí
'Pérame ahí, que yo soy idiota (Ah)
Se te olvidó que estoy en otra
Y que te quedó grande La Bichota

Tú te fuiste y yo me puse triple M
Más buena, más dura, más level
Volver contigo never (No), tú eras la mala suerte
Porque ahora la' bendicione' me llueven
Y quiere' volver, ya lo suponía
Dándole like a la foto mía

Yo diciendo que era monotonía
Y ahora quieres volver, ya lo suponía
Dándole like a la foto mía (A la mía)
Te ves feliz con tu nueva vida

Drop her down to four-wheel drive on a Friday night

If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I'd put my money down and I'd sign my name
On that little corner lot where it don't ever rain
And we'd stay good as new like a fresh coat of paint
You'd be mine in the shine of a front porch light
Yeah, I might as well live there, baby
That's where I spend most of my time

[Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled up mornings lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder
We'd never let go and we'd never be over

[Verse 2]
If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I wouldn't have to wonder if you miss me the same
I'd be loving you as usual, telling you you're beautiful
Oh, I'd be happily delusional

Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled up mornings lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder

No he mandado los mensajes, siguen todos ahí

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

And I'm a monster on the hill

I could never hate you even if I tried
Girl, I love you too much and I've loved you too long to fight
Mm
It ain't always a bad thing saying goodbye
And the last thing that I wanna be is a waste of your time

[Chorus]
There's nothing I could say
To make you wanna stay
Your heart made up it's mind
I don't want you to lie one more minute
You ain't done nothing wrong
I'm not where you belong
Don't let one teardrop fall
Girl, you think it's your fault but it isn't
I fell in love and you didn't

[Verse 2]
I hope you find someone
To be the person for you
Mm
That you were to me, what I wanted to bе for you
I, I ain't ever asked you to sеttle or compromise
Girl, you deserve everything in this world
Even if it means you can't be mine

I'ma take your smile and turn it upside down
I'ma take the sun and cover it in clouds
I still hear your voice in my head, it's loud

'Til the bottle's empty

Hope you hear me now

Falling in and out of love, turned me to the drugs

And now I'm sending you the saddest soundtrack

Now I know it wasn't love
So, I'm sending you the saddest soundtrack
No, you won't call back

Outskirts,Sam Hunt,Outskirts,73,"5 ContributorsOutskirts Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's so much goin' on in this town
To keep me busy, I've been runnin' around
Up and down all these avenues
Doin' everything but thinkin' 'bout you
As long as I stay on 'em, I'm fine
The city side of those city limit signs
You don't really cross my mind

[Chorus]
But soon as I get out here on the outskirts
I wish I was runnin' by your house first
Somethin' 'bout a summer in the south sure
Shines like gold down these old
Round bail, river valley back roads
Way back in the holler where the grass grows
God almighty, baby, we were that close
To ditchin' this town and settlin' down
Out here on the outskirts

[Verse 2]
If I'da had a lick of damn sense
I'd be on the greener side of that fence
Little starter house we've finally outgrown
Twelve-hundred feet we're 'bout to add on
Smilin' out there watchin' them
Big ol' yellow buckets 'bout to break ground
While you're shootin' all my baby names down

To ditchin' this town and settlin' down

I'm over all these Saturday nights
I miss the stars in your eyes

We were gonna give up on the fast life
Have a couple babies, raise 'em up right
Take 'em to the river, get 'em baptized
Back in our day, if I'da just stayed
I wouldn't be livin' in this condo

Last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night

[Verse 1]
I kiss your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talkin' about life goin' sip for sip, yeah
You, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me

[Chorus]
I know that last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)

[Verse 2]
No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You called your momma, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull her right back up
Yeah my, my friends say ""Let her go""
Your friends say ""What the hell?""
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else

No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can’t remember everything we said but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)

I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should, I might

[Chorus]
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him, though
Rather be in jail than alone

[Verse 2]
I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I try to ration with you, no murders, no crime of passion
But, damn, you was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in amazement, playin' on my patience
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat

[Verso 1: Pedro Tovar & Peso Pluma]
Mi compa, ¿qué le parece esa morra?
La que anda bailando sola me gusta pa' mí
¡Bella! Ella sabe que está buena
Que todos andan mirándola cómo baila
Me acerco y le tiro todo un verbo
Tomamos tragos sin peros, solo tentación
Le dije: ""Voy a conquistar tu familia, que en unos días vas a ser mía""
Me dijo que estoy muy loco, pero le gusta
Que ningún vato como yo actúa

[Interludio: Pedro Tovar & Peso Pluma]
Y ahí te va, mija
Y pura Doble P, viejo
Así nomás, compa Pedro
Puro Eslabon Armado
Pa' las plebitas
¡Cha-chau!

[Verso 2: Peso Pluma & Pedro Tovar]
No soy un vato que tiene varo
Pero hablando del corazón te cumplo todo
Me agarró pegadito dе su mano
Mi compa ni se la creyó, que al pasar fui yo
Su cuеrpo, juro por Dios, que era tan perfecta
Su cinturita como modelo
Sus ojos desde el principio me enamoraron
A ella le gusto y a mí me gusta

I walk London with the [?] five fingers of  death
Leave MCs with five fingers or less
Sex Mel B [?] finger the rest
[?]
I piss on your face and make you as wet
As the victims of the Marchioness
I'm the last you wanna test
[?] like your mum dressing up a Flash Gordon
And your dad like Ming the Merciless
In school I used to grab girl chest
Now I grab up MCs and butt them
Till they smoke cocaine in their sets

[Verse 2, Jehst]
I hit dew
And swap tin boots for gym shoes
Moving like a cool cat
On a hot tin roof
Sugar lipped, sweet tooth
[?] food and drink brews
[?] fools hustling
Rustling king blues
Card shuffling
But we're only playing for fun
Soaking up the solar power as we lay in the Sun
We bun the soul flower now
Until the day is done
I twist spinach
And sip Guinness
Until this script's finished

Case is no one
We shine with no Sun
There's no guns
Cash is lonesome
So there's no funds
We flow some
What
Competitive
But sucking on A&R private parts
Is still now repetitive
So
My etiquette is [no land dragon ?]
There's basically no British rap bandwagon
That the fans happen to have
It's Hip-Hop
So what if after that you went down the pub
And after that up to the chip shop?

[Chorus, Supa T and vocoder]
Say Ugh!
Do the salsa smurf
Ruff!

[Verse 4, Supa T]
Django smash your party night like Harry White

Slaughter beats by Mr Sheen
Yeah I'm [?] to the elements
So I don't need a Walkman
Make you choke on your bad words
Tie knots in your [?]
Champions come humdrum?
You won't be seeing that
Smack heavy on the track
While you're curing insomniacs
Spit your boring arse babble raps
I stay zoning
Get the b-boys off the floor so we can groove for a moment
[Verse 5, Lewis Parker]
They get smoked out like Cheech
Do this for one and each
While I'm standing on the beach
Singing ""Save The World""
Think of all the fly girls going crazy for the kiwi
Trying to keep it simple so the suckers think it's easy
So when they try to bite
They get confused
Trying to take it out
But
Nature doesn't lose
We're on a funk cruise
So sit back and enjoy
With Sun vibes like Roy
Because we're keeping all the airs
With the kicks, hats and snares
Break it down to the bares
I said your DJ's got the flairs
But he can't do the [?]
My DJ rocks the old style
And all the girls love it
Play this out like a puppet
Old theories recovered
It's a special request
Salsa Smurf's how we does it
[Supa T]
So get your boys out
And don't dub it!
[Verse 6, L.Dolo with vocoder]
Now it's time for something new
Something borrowed, something old
Something broken down and put together again
By who?
L Dolo
So if you wonder why the sky's blue
It's reflections from the SP
Specifically from Fuji
And me?
I'm just a hip-hop loving MC
The type you wish you were
But you're still claiming to be
Dropping clue likes a lazy Dr Watson
So you don't get the point
I will administer general anaesthetic
No option

[Coro: Payo Solís]
Me queda 1%
Y lo usaré solo para decirte lo mucho que lo siento
Que si me ven con otra en una disco solo es perdiendo el tiempo
Baby, ¿pa' qué te miento?
Eso de que me vieron feliz, no, no es cierto

[Verso 1: Payo Solís]
Ya nada me hace reír
Solo cuando veo las fotos y los vídeos que tengo de ti
Salí con otra para olvidarte y tenía el perfume que te gusta a ti
Prendo para irme a dormir
Porque duermo mejor si sueño que estás aquí
Si supieras que te escribí
No he mandado los mensajes, siguen todos ahí
Wow, qué mucho me ha costa'o
Quizás te hice un favor cuando me fui de tu lado
Borracho viendo tus fotos, me duele ver que tú sí has mejorado
No tienes días grises, ya no te duelen las cicatrices
Y yo pensando si decirte que

I see you're lookin' for someone to scoop you right off of your feet
You want to ride in the Wraith
You want to go out on dates
You want somebody to come bring you flowers
Someone to talk to for hours
Wash your back while y'all sit in the shower (Yeah)
Someone to tell you, ""You're beautiful""
Someone to tell you and mean it
Someone to tell you, ""I love you"" everyday and don't got a reason
You want someone to bring you peace (Uh)

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?

[Chorus]
It's me, hi

At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

Fast Car,Luke Combs,Gettin' Old,89,"5 ContributorsFast Car Lyrics[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising and entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
Said I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged

Kicking with my friends overseas car keys for the freaks
Did enough shows, we'll be back again
Wanna save the world on the go
Grandma in a grave, rest her soul
Wish she lived to be a hundred
So she could see her boy gettin' old
Gettin' grown, takin' care of business

Old school actin' humble
Grippin' on the grain, I ain't been the same, niggas in trouble

It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

What Is Real?,The Band That Saved The World,Name in Lights,33,"1 ContributorThe Celluloid Road Lyrics[I. The American Watchworld]

I go there nearly every night, I find the accents so familiar...
If I heard one here in town, I'd spin myself around
To see who was talking like they were on TV
From America!

Steam rises from pavements in this strange world
Of fire escapes and trash cans
Muted brass sets the tone of the scene
And though the backdrop's not that clean
There's always someone on hand to sort it out - in America

Bruce Willis has the airport locked down and
Hollywood superstars are running the town
Peter Parker writes it all in the free press
(While his editor puts him under serious duress)
And if I ate Italian, well I might be scared
That some kind of gunfight would break out down the stairs
Jack Bauer's 'gone dark' and there's an APB
It's a hell of a job defending the Land Of The Free

But it looks alright! In the TV light
America, is that you?
Or did we get it right?
You might also likeI know your monuments by heart
Climbed down Mount Rushmore in the moonlight
(I've never been to Dakota though
I just dropped in for the show
Bought my North By Northwest poster - at HMV)

And so I guess I'd be nervous waiting for a Greyhound Bus
Although the people around me might not see the fuss
But maybe if a crop duster was doing the nearby fields
They'd be running just like me?
And if I met some end in a backstreet night
The cops'd have the coffee and donuts ready by first light
And maybe if I was lucky I'd get Sandra Bullock on the case
Any my Greyhound Bus would get me any place!

[II. Cops & Boxes]

America, did we get it right?
Or is what I see from the chair in my room
Some kind of illusion through the Yorkshire gloom
Oh America, do we see it right?
Oh you've got people swinging from buildings
(And a bomb's just about to go off, one man armies on every street corner - so I wouldn't worry, that guy in the deli is probably some kind of ex-marine)
Hey will you save me from the End Of The World
From the curse of the Bad Guys, 'cos that's what I heard
Oh America, do we see you right?
[III. On The Road Again]

Let's take the Freeway, try to lose the town
Let's eat some distance, see what's goin' down
I'll be Dennis Hopper, you be Thelma (or Louise)
We'll kick up dust as the sun strobes through the trees
And we'll have ourselves a real Easy Ride

A Motel hoarding looms out of the dust
Abandoned steelworks glowing with rust
Watching all those telegraph wires
Follow the eternal yellow line

We're on the Road again!
We're on the Road

And I'm half hoping that some guy in a truck
Is gonna chase me through the landscape (be just my luck)
I wanna stop at diners where they spit on the floor
And give you long, cold looks when you walk through the door

Rivers getting deeper, mountains getting high
Roads are getting smaller 'neath the bigger, bluer sky
Bridges made of matchwood in a country made of iron
And ""Jesus Saves"" - if you believe the signs
Fin-tailed Caddies and thick milk shakes
Dunkin' Donuts and screeching brakes
Tarantino makes it all live again
(With a 'Motherfucker' dropped in, every now and then)
We're on the road.....

[IV. The Inner Heart]

And far from the Freeway
Where we find your inner heart
Of Cowboys and Cacti, Meth Labs and Mountains
Holes in the desert with the bodies of gangsters
Or Indians from the movies...

Rattlesnakes
And Salt Lakes
All here
All true
Under the unrelenting sun
And deep underground
They're at Def Con One

[V. San Francisco]

I've seen this town in ruins, its bridges broken twice
I've seen it take an earthquake, bombarded by ice
Attacked by giant lizards and levelled to the ground
I've seen it in the future when there's no-one around
But you can still buy a pizza

And half the region's folklore comes from the city jails
Whether it's Clint or Johnny Cash, the underdog prevails
I've walked the Wharf with James Bond, seen Gandalf lift the bridge
I was safely in England when the aliens made their pitch

Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!

The future home of Starfleet, the LAST home of the whales
(A Bird of Prey still rusting beneath your silver waves)
Skyscraper infernoes, militia on The Rock
Volkswagens that drive themselves
And apes that freely talk

Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!

[spoken]
Who's the band that gets all the chicks?
The Tangent!
You're damn right!

Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!

The Tangent!

Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!
Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!

America, did we get it right?
San Francisco, San Francisco
America, did we get it right?
Oh San Francisco, what a world! What a place! What a life!

But I'm just eavesdropping on an LED screen
From the centre of England, can I believe what I've seen?
Will I ever walk those streets again?

[VI. The American Watchworld (Reprise)]

America, my love affair goes on
That faith in flag and proud salute still touch me
As in your world of men, you save the President again
And have your troops back home in time for the parade

Once again, tears fill my eyes
As the future hero drops his first catch
But the montage you make will show him
Gain wisdom as he grows
And we all wish we could grow up like him

Somebody hand me a cigarette
I know I ain't had one in over a week
Somebody pour me a double shot
Been gettin' better by the day, but tonight I drink

You say I gotta get over you and get sober too
I got a lot of habits I gotta kick
But weigh out all your options and take your pick

I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind

Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

[Bridge]
Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)

[Breakdown]
'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me
[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?

Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me

You swear that you're stayin' single, next thing you know
You meet a girl at a bar and next thing you know
You get her laughin', it's 2AM
You're tellin' your buddies, three months in
That she ain't movin' in, the next thing you know
There's a U-Haul trailer, the next thing you know
Your old apartment, is y'all's new place
There goes the carpet but the deer head stays

[Chorus]
Next thing you know
You're savin' money like never before, just to
Spend it all at a jewelry store
Gettin' down on one knee on hеr mama's porch
Just prayin' she don't say, ""No""
Next thing you know
Your best man givеs a half-drunk speech and you're
Sunburnt on a honeymoon beach and your
Left hand's gettin' used to that ring
And there the next two or three years go
Next thing you know

[Verse 2]
You weren't really tryin', next thing you know
There's a test on the counter, next thing you know
She's standin' there cryin', noddin' her head yes
You're half excited, half scared to death

Doctor's sayin', how you doin' there dad and
Nobody's ever called you that
And you take that drive home slow

It's first steps, first dates, first car
It's 11:01 wonderin' where they are
You're sayin' that USC's too far
It's amazing how fast seventeen years go
Next thing you know

Next thing you know
You get to know your wife again and you're
More in love than you've ever been
With a lot of years of remember when's and still some down the road

And you take 'em to church, teach 'em to fish
And you, tell 'em stories every chance you get

She never wanted to be white-picket fenced in
Her heart's like a feather in a Tulsa wind
Seaside breeze'll bring her to life
And all them other boys say she's a goodbye girl
She'll wreck your world
And leave before the mornin' sun
But here she is, free, lyin' next to me
'Cause I ain't tryna tame her love

[Chorus]
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild

[Verse 2]
Saw that highway unwind in her deep-brown eyes
She saw a long stretch of dirt road dreamin' in mine
She ain't livin' for a diamond ring
Just livin' like the rock 'n' roll song she sings out loud
We're burnin' it down
Blazin' up a trail of smoke
Wherever we are, wherever we go
Yeah, that's where she calls home

She wanna hit Highlight Room and show it off
Got a new body, girl, show it off
This a Brazilian, I know it's soft
Toned up and she got a six-pack
Look like she used to play volleyball

Don't worry 'bout your friend's story when I had her alone

They gon' tell you it's a chill night, tell you how they'd rather stay home, yeah

[Intro: 21 Savage & Young Nudy]
Go buy a zip of weed, hit the club
Pay for 'bout ten niggas to get in
We crunk, lit, in this bitch, yeah
Know we walk around the world
Steppin', not givin a damn 'bout where our feet land at, yeah
Get your ass mushed, smooshed (6ix)
Yeah, 21, the biggest
Put a nigga in the chicken wing, pussy

[Chorus: Drake & 21 Savage]
21, can you do somethin' for me? (21)
Can you hit a lil' rich flex for me? (21)
And 21, can you do somethin' for me? (21, 21)
Drop some bars to my pussy ex for me
Then 21 (21), can you do somethin' for me? (Yeah)
Can you talk to the opps necks for me? (Okay)
21, do your thing 21, do your thing (21)
Do your thing, 21, do your thing

[Verse: 21 Savage]
Yellow diamonds in the watch, this shit cost a lot
Never send a bitch your dot, that's how you get shot
I DM in Vanish Mode, I do that shit a lot
Took her panties off and this bitch thicker than the plot
All my exes ain't nothin', them hoes busted
If my opps ain't rappin', they ass duckin'
You ain't ready to pull the trigger, don't clutch it
I know you on your period baby, can you suck it?
I'm a savage (21)
Smack her booty in Magic (21, 21)
I'll slap a pussy nigga with a ratchet (Pussy)
I might slap a tracker on his whip and get the addy (Pussy)
Don't call me on Christmas Eve, bitch, call your daddy (21)
Bitch, call your uncle (21), bitch, don't call me (21)
Always in my ear, your ho a flea (Fuck)
Why my opps be posting guns and only use they feet? (21)

[Intro: Drake]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm on that Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit, ayy

[Verse: Drake]
Sticks and stones, chrome on chrome
That's just what a nigga on
Internet clones, got 'em kissin' through the phone
Pussies cliquin' up so they don't feel alone, ayy
Nan' nigga seein' me, I'm Young Money CMB
I used to roll with CMG, the house is not a BNB
The bad bitches waitin' on a nigga like I'm PND
I'm steady pushin' P, you niggas pushing PTSD
I told her ass to kiss me in the club, fuck a TMZ
I used to want a GMC, when Woe was doing B&E
We revvin' up and goin' on a run like we DMC
I layup with her for a couple days, then its BRB
You rappers love askin' if I fucked, when you know we did
When you know we did
She came in heels but she left out on her cozy shit
Ayy, I'm livin' every twenty-four like Kobe did
Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P to 8
Swear this shit is gettin' ate, I'm on ten for the cake
Get a lot of love from twelve, but I don't reciprocate
Fifty-one division stay patrollin' when it's late
21 my addy, so the knife is on the gate
All the dawgs eatin' off a Baccarat plate
Niggas see Drake and they underestimate
Take it from a vet', that's a rookie ass mistake, ayy
[Outro: Drake & Young Nudy]
Ah, what, what
Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit

Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

[Verse 1: RAYE]
A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel

[Verse 2: RAYE]
Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with

I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways
[Chorus: RAYE & 070 Shake]
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please

[Verse 3: 070 Shake & RAYE]
'Cause I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
Be at peace with the things you can't change (Last night)
I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah
Out of reach, out of touch
Too numb, I don't feel no way
Toast up, so what?
Street small, but it go both ways
So, you'll run, yeah
But you'll never escape
Sunset in the maze
(You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel)

I don't wanna feel how I did last night, oh

I don't wanna feel how I did last night

[Outro: RAYE]
Mm, lipstick smudged like modern art
I don't know where the fuck I am or who's drivin' the fuckin' car
Speedin' down the highway, sippin'

If your kiss turned me to stone
I'd be a statue standing tall in ancient Rome
And if your touch shattered me like glass
I’d be in pieces trying to make the breaking last

At least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes

There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you’d be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway

[Verse 2]
I know just tryin' to write a song
I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong
And well, I guess what I'm tryin' to say
Is there ain't words been made could shoulder so much weight

And if you turned your back on me and walked away
Not a thing about the way I feel would change

Me muero por ver tus ojos al volver

No se va a poder, por más que lo intente
Te tocó perder, olvida ya el ayer
Hace un mes
También te quería ver

Qué detallazo pa' mensajear con la muerte
Una colt siete chinos que de retrato trae
Al señor de la montaña, de los drones y demás
Cuernos del diablo junto a mi seguridad
Viejo lobo en verguiza para el polvo traficar
Dios siempre me cuida y mi gorrita de Elegua

[Pre-Coro: Junior H & Peso Pluma]
En la sangre traigo el 701
Melena de león, pues vengo de uno
Siempre amafiado, pues no somos culos
Bajo perfil el chavalón y se le extraña
Aunque se fue, nunca se le olvida
Bélicos ya somos, bélicos morimos

I'm back goin' hard again, I'm shuttin' down my heart again
No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win
I'm back goin' hard again, I'm shuttin' down my heart again
No one can get next to me, so they gotta put orders in
Try my best to act like I didn't care, but I can't hold it in and
I'm not into losin', I go hard as I can go to win

[Verse 1]
You pillow talkin' to hoes again
You breakin' the code again
I'm on the road again
We snuck in this bitch with them poles again
This chopper do tricks, you gon' go fold it in
I know they be hatin', I still post they shit
We slid on they block like we 'posed to slid
This Glock been with me on my road to riches
We done over-sold the load again
Too many plays, been up for too many days
Boy, you a bitch, you got feminine ways
I get the drop, I'ma pay, they gon' spray where you stay
I had to check on my man, think he part of the Klan
Keep a mask, he got too many Ks
I had to run up them bands when I got out the can
Can't go back, I got too many cases
He actin' bad on the 'Gram, but we know what's gon' happen
It happen in every occasion
Somebody killed, I be tellin' my youngins to chill
Check the stats, I do numbers, for real
And this ain't no cap, I get money, for real
That lil' boy ain't run up no commas, for real
Don't play with Baby, I go million for million
I made it out, but yet I'm still in the field
Five hundred racks sittin' in my Urus
Ten carat diamonds spent in my earlobes
Superhero Baby, savin' the ghetto
If I'm not the man, I'm the man in the middle
Hop out the car with my hand on my pistol
He just a fan and he mad I don't feel him
I know they know that I ran with them killers
Fuck it, you know I still run with them guys
Drivebys a waste of my time, I want somebody to die
I risk it all, put my sack on the line
I came from the back of the line
We had it crackin' since back when lil' one was alive
You can go ask on my line
I wish Lil Woo would've never went through with his move
But I'm glad that he through with his dime, yeah

Know they mad 'cause they can't take a seat with me
Got the best of the best in the sheets with me
Hands down, can't nobody compete with me

I got ten million cash from my last album
I'm just waitin' on bronem to max out
Every show that I get, it be packed out
Five K for your teeth, you got ripped off
Spent a hundred thousand on mine
Crack a smile just to show the diamonds
From the corner to another continent
Got a baby daddy? I don't wanna hit
Need a Nike deal how I'm runnin' shit
He can't come to the A, he on punishment
Catch that boy out of place, we gon' punish him
Take his chain and his watch on some funny shit

Gotta fuck me for free, ain't no money, bitch

We had twenty vibes out in Vegas

(Cook that shit up, Quay)

[Verse 1]
Go to lunch in the Jewish community (Yeah)
I wouldn't tell on the bros with immunity (Nah)
Playin' victim, that shit ain't gon' ruin me
I'm the only now that outdo me
I got hoes by the group tryna do me
My life like a movie, get head in the water
Don't gotta put in no work, I send orders
This shit done got serious, them millions come plural, I'm living by morals
We swipe 'em, ain't keepin', no Dora Explorer
I'm young and I'm turnt, I got bitches galore
My baby, my whip cost two-fifty, I'm splurgin'
Got five million cash just in case of emergency
My young niggas kill, get away, they be purgin'
It happened like this, I ain't do it on purpose
I'm working my move, nigga, which one of you workin'?
I turned on my crew, bought a coupe off of verses
I'm tired of these strippers, I'm going at nurses and doctors and dentists
You started, I finished, I told you we with it
My word is like gold to my city
I tell 'em to go, they gon' get it
I heard that you froze when they hit it
Putting these hoes in the business, you know that you tripping
I tell 'em no, they gon' listen
Knowin' these niggas be sweet and some bitches, I'm different

Run through the load, call the plug, I need more pounds
I put on drip every day from the floor up
I'm getting sick of this shit, pour some more up, yeah

[Verse 2]
Cullinan shot in, my driver named Solid
I keep him on point, make sure nobody follow us
I got a Glock with a shot that can stop a truck
I get the money eight ways like an octopus
No way in hell I'ma give all these choppers up
Team full of players, ain't nobody stopping us
He out of line, give a fuck, then we poppin' him
Been raisin' hell, back in school, I was popular, yeah
All of my hoes get facials, face me
Make her my bitch too much, she lazy
I was thinking prices too high, then I raised 'em
Shit in my bank account gettin' outrageous
Niggas smellin' like that, had to switch up my fragrance
And I'm sending out shots if the fouls get flagrant
Switch up my route to the house, had to change it
Still with the shit, I forget that I'm famous
[Chorus]
She tryna leave me, I'm low down
I hang with savages, don't bring your ho 'round

But somewhere I picked up this old guitar

I went lookin' at pictures I didn't wanna see
They brought back memories
You look happy, I guess, got the life that you wanted
But it ain't with me
You would think by now that I wouldn't care
It's been a couple years and, yeah, I've had my share
Of other broken-up hearts, but I only shed real tears over ours

[Chorus]
And now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me

And now I'm in the back of the church
Prayin' just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me

I thought I'd marry you
Act like I'm happier now, but all of my friends know
That ain't the truth

If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I'd put my money down and I'd sign my name
On that little corner lot where it don't ever rain
And we'd stay good as new like a fresh coat of paint
You'd be mine in the shine of a front porch light
Yeah, I might as well live there, baby
That's where I spend most of my time

[Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled up mornings lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder
We'd never let go and we'd never be over

[Verse 2]
If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I wouldn't have to wonder if you miss me the same
I'd be loving you as usual, telling you you're beautiful
Oh, I'd be happily delusional

[Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled up mornings lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder

When you kiss her on the street
When you kiss her when she’s still asleep

It stays on her mind
When you put her first

When you think she don’t notice

Man Made A Bar (feat. Eric Church),Morgan Wallen,One Thing At A Time,81,"11 ContributorsMan Made a Bar Lyrics[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
I sat down on a barstool, like a dern fool
'Cause she walked out again
Bartender said, ""I got you, yeah, 'cause I, too
Have been in your boots, my friend
Opened up back in '85
Got me over my first wife
Been stayin' busy since the first night""
It's a story old as time

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
God made the world in seven short days
He said it was good, I bet it was great
Then God made a man, and man got lonely
He said, ""Please, Lord, if I could only
Have an angel to hold in my arms""
So God made a girl, His best work of art
Oh, but He didn't make no place to go when she breaks your hеart
So man made a bar

[Verse 2: Eric Church]
For some guys it's a good time, thе half price
Half dozen buckets of beer
Some say it's a cover band, that's a cover man
I know why they're here
Didn't go the way you planned it
Damn, the devil did some damage

Sometimes an angel falls too hard
Loses more than just a piece of her heart
And she needs a place to go and make a brand new start

Dear God, please
Hear me out, I know it's been a couple years
Since I've reached
Out and said hello, I bet You're wondering
Why I keep
Obsessing on and stressin' all the little things
When I should be
Living life and soaking up the memories
I know I've been selfish, I have
No excuse to give You, it's true
Hanging by a thread's how I live
I don't know why, but I feel more comfortable

Livin' in my agony
Watchin' my self-esteem
Go up in flames, acting like I don't
Care what anyone else thinks
When I know truthfully
That that's the furthest thing from how I
Feel, but I'm too proud to open up and ask ya
To pick me up and pull me out this hole I'm trapped in

I got some traumas that I can't forget
I got some phone calls I been avoidin'
Some family members I don't really connect with
Some things I said I wish I woulda not let slip
Some hurtful words that never shoulda left my lips
Some bridges burned I'm not ready to rebuild yet
Some insecurities I haven't dealt with, yes
I'll be the first to admit that I'm a lonely soul
And the last to admit I need a hand to hold
Losin' hope, headed down a dangerous road

And I always wear long sleeves

Well, the sadness, yeah, I promise that it won't last
And if I could, I would try to take it all back
There's still more underneath and that's when you say to me

Jag känner mig fast (Mig fast)
Jag har tagit ett piller, typ, what the fuck? (What the fuck?)
Jag är i trädet (Trädet), hon ropar upp (Ropar up)
Vad behöver du? (Vad behöver du?) Jag har det (Ooh-ooh)

[Vers 1: Don Toliver]
Jag vet inte varför dessa horor inte kan stå ut med mig
Jag antar jag är för krävande
Vill ta dubbel kokain, godiset (Godiset)
Jag är så hög, ingen landning (Landning)
Har den Glocken, grepp stadigt (Stadigt)
Bär den skiten, konfetti (Konfetti)
De låter allt sändas på TV (TV)
De alla vill gnida min mage
Jag har mina bröder ute, jag är i Ritz (I-)
Jag får de komma in, skit ser ut som en blitz (Ser ut som en-)
Hon vill kolla in mig, hon vill kolla in min outfit (Kolla in min-)
Jag kör upp, Maybach hoppar, bäst bruden kan mina hits
Jag vet inte varför dessa horor inte kan stå ut med mig
Jag antar jag är för krävande
Privat ladning, jag antar jag behåller mitt godis
Hon en vattenpistol när stränderna sandiga
Jag har henne i O, kalla, bättre kalla mig Randy

[Vers 2: Future & Don Toliver]
Diamanter och Margiela, AP gula
Yeah, hon förtjänar en Patek, för hon en av medlemmarna (Ja)
När det kommer, är det förtjusande, pengar inte ett problem (Hmm)
Gjorde mig till en mördare, jag knulla nyss en modell (Yeah)
Tiffany kom blå, hennes fitta bra och rosa (Rosa)
Chicago under vintern, jag beställer pälsar (Päls)
Säljer ut arenor, jag rånade nyss gatan (Gatan)
Köper ett helt nytt slott i mellanöstern (Woo, yeah)
Min bitch sitter som en indian när vi sitter ner och äter (Woo)
Jag kan göra den här skiten, en tagning, men min stil är inte gratis (Woo, Pluto)
Jag tar inga horor på dejter, om de inte har fina fötter (Jag svär)
Fyra miljoner på hennes huvud, fyra miljoner på hennes huvud (Ah, yeah)
Hon gör det bäst, jag kan inte känna mina ben (Mina ben, jag svär)
Jag dödade din man för en smula bröd (Man)
Har pengar upp till taket, det går genom taket (Pengar)
Min nya bitch, hon sanningen, visade mig några miljoner (Freebandz)

Could you tell where my head was at when you found me?
Me and you went to hell and back just to find peace
Man, I thought I had everything, I was lonely
Now you're my everything, I was lonely

[Verse 1]
I mixed a lot of love with a lot of drugs, then I found you
She liked petty crimes, she had green eyes like Mountain Dew
And where she go, I'll never know, her friends bounced too
I guess it's their loss 'cause they'll never know what we'll amount to
Would you be my light, be my yellow?
P.Y.T. walking down Portobello
Put a smile on this face at the end of the day
MDMA helped us fly away
Who'd have known, who'd have known you would save my life?
Who'd have known, who'd have known you would fly my kite?
Could you tell, could you tell?
Could you tell, could you tell?

Got my head in the clouds, countin' all my stars
In my ears, said the world was ours
Went to hell and back just to heal my wounds

I'm the king of NYC
I heard they send my music to police
So this is a message to NYPD
I cap in my raps, I'm an innocent tweep
Keep a teddy bear when I sleep
I'm rappin' the words, but they write it for me
Me? I'm all about keepin' the peace
I mean, at least I get paid 'cause a lot of these rappers be cappin' for free
They call me The Ock
I got the bread, she chopped but said, ""Can I bring a friend?""
Never, never, never, I guess she forgot the bev', like
Two fives don't equal a ten
Quick math, don't try it again
She shaped like a turtle or a hen
Her makeup is fucked, she don't know how to blend
Make her do Wordle
She need to have brains if she givin' out head
Call her Virgil
'Cause the way she be blowin' shit got me dead
Haha, shawty got arctan
I wanna intersect her circle
She like, ""Mabu, I like purple""
So I blew her back out and I left her on read

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

It hit like a train, I ran out of words

And I know love leads to pain
But memories serve our sweetest refrain, mmm

And I always wear long sleeves
Is it in your childhood? Somethin' happen in your past?
Well, the sadness, yeah, I promise that it won't last
And if I could, I would try to take it all back
There's still more underneath and that's when you say to me

Uh
I just put, I just put a tonne on the back of a truck (Uh)
Me and Midgy should’ve won the Cannabis Cup
I ain’t put no plaques on my wall yet
By at least five, I’ll send those packs to your doorstep
In this, in this music scene I’m legendary
Raps always been secondary like February
Told my guy, “Don’t come near me with no tester” (Uh)
Don’t be talkin’ packs ‘round Siri and Alexa
Free the gang, I can't forget my celly
I was gettin' letters in the can, like alphabets spaghetti, uh
All these niggas bite my style
I did ""A-Wings Got Talent"" in jail, I was like Simon Cowell
I was in cali 'round the neck like bow tie
K-K-Kush God, bitch, I'm the most high
I see these rappers actin' Holly' (Uh)
When they were out there crowd surfing, we were catchin' bodies (Who were they?)
I ain't a tough guy, I always make everybody laugh
I could spit all my bars wearin' a polygraph
Rap star, still makin' pounds fly
Opps tryna' turn me stray like Ivory from How High
Used to shot ounces
Had a sold out tour, but I still got more fans in my crop houses
I spray up where you're cotchin'
Spent all my money on packs, I was literally weighing up my options
They say their guns spit, they ain't never done shit
Just landed the runtz 'bout to roll up a trumpet, uh
She want a man with P, but that bitch poor
That's why I'm in her crib hiding keys like a jigsaw
Still got food on the curb
I pull up with this half moon, I don't mean do not disturb
Came alone, could've brought an army
If I air it out, forensics will have to pick up more men than Lori Harvey
Came a long way from trappin' in the rain
My chicks a side bitch 'cause I'm married to the game, uh
Me and Budz in Dubai on a jetski
Sold so much coke like I'm rivals with Pepsi
I used to break these packs down into fractions
These niggas do way too much capping in their captions
I'm tryna leave the game but I need a lane (Uh)
These niggas pree the chain, they don't see the pain
They sent me jail for importing weed from Spain
I came home, in six weeks released a strain
Still remember reloading on a Q
We got them jungle boys, it ain't Mowgli and Baloo
The CM wishing they could bring me back
Cah they still need gangsters like me to point their fingers at, uh
Last year I was missing rap
I was on the wing kicking back with my nigga Skrapz
Even though my block's full of pricks, I ain't (Nah)
And I don't trust bitches even if my chick's a saint
Paid for my last campaign, label ain't reimbursed me
Smashed her and never picked up cah she was thirsty
They just started, I was shipping packs time ago
Trading flavours with all the growers outside my show, uh
This ain't happened cause of luck
Fuck your little chain, I spend that shit at Hakkasan on duck
To make it to a kilo, that was the game plan
When I had no 'nect like I was playing Rayman
Used to have a thirty-eight when I was trapping in the snow
Still got it to this day, I even brang it to my show, uh
I can move a hundred keys in less than a week
Driving through the other side like this is Sesame Street (Pussies)
Still the same old me even though I'm rich
And it's still gang gang, I'll never switch

I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should, I might

[Chorus]
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him, though
Rather be in jail than alone

[Verse 2]
I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I try to ration with you, no murders, no crime of passion
But, damn, you was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in amazement, playin' on my patience
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat

I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

And he told me that it's over, dumb decision

In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel

[Verse 2: RAYE]
Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways
[Chorus: RAYE & 070 Shake]
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel, mm (What?)

[Verse 3: 070 Shake & RAYE]
'Cause I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
Be at peace with the things you can't change (Last night)
I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah
Out of reach, out of touch
Too numb, I don't feel no way
Toast up, so what?
Street small, but it go both ways
So, you'll run, yeah
But you'll never escape
Sunset in the maze

Away games, she always FaceTimes me, taking selfies
Thursday's on the 'Gram looking rich and sexy
Got an AP on, but her fridge is empty, uh (If I'm lyin', I'm dyin')

Fakir daha da fakirleşirken
Se mira Maria, köşede
Bir şeyleri yoluna koymak için düşünüyor
Posta kutumda, bir tahliye mektubu var
Hakim tarafından imzalanmış, sonra görüşürüz dedi

Fuck lookin' for love
I'ma stay doin' what us bitches do best

Flip a switch on a prick, then I
Come alive in the nighttime
In the club, sippin' Hennessy
And tell him I'm dead if he callin' me
Flip a switch on a prick and I'm
A very sound bitch till you cross that line
Black heels, black shades, that my energy
Tell him I'm dead if he callin' me

You're a very silly man, block, block, mute chat
New addy in the sat, new dicks on tap
Got a best case, worst case, plan of attack
Got bitches, if they see you in the street, you're gettin' slapped
Don't threaten me or talk to me ever like that

And I would tell you kiss my ass, I know you wish that you could

Seasoned the speed, now I'm over the man who was sleepin' underneath me
Said I couldn't live without you when I loved you
Well, I lied and you shouldn't have believed me
Twenty-four hours in the bed and believe me, it's 'bout to get freaky
Only get to see me when you see me on a phone screen, G

Can't you just make it move faster?
Lovely to be sitting here with you
You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short

Then you're driving me home
And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before

Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos

I heard Jesus did cocaine on a night out
Eyes wide open, dilated, but he's fine now
And if his father ever finds out, then he'd probably knock his lights out
Gets a little messy in Heaven, gets a little messy in Heaven

[Verse 1]
Barefoot on the pavement, he was never complacent
Held his ground for the town and the statement
Leader, never backs out of the arrangеment
Speaks out to the wholе crowd when he saves them
But he was the one that needed saving
Now he's low-key crushed on the inside
He gave his all and now he's breaking
You can see it in his eyes

[Chorus]
I heard Jesus did cocaine on a night out
Eyes wide open, dilated, but he's fine now
And if his father ever finds out, then he'd probably knock his lights out
Gets a little messy in Heaven, gets a little messy in Heaven

[Verse 2]
He's staying out on the weekdays, weekends
No sleep for the weak 'round here
Going out, getting lost in the deep end
White lines never dried no tears
He says no more, now he says no less
And the people wanna know where he goes next
Mind of a saint, so he knows best
But he don't sleep, nah, he don't rest
Turning water into wine, that's mad, that's mad
Everybody always wants what he has

Relax My Eyes,ANOTR,The Reset,59,"1 ContributorKill the Spirit LyricsIn the ghetto, where you hardly see love
Sometimes hugs, but a whole lotta thugs and drugs
The value of life is low
Brothers hanging out, straight going with the flow
But the flow is twisted and wicked
You don't agree, you need to check the statistics, man
It should make you think
Can't you see the black male's on the brink of becoming extinct?

So I stop, dwell on that thought, it brings tears to my eyes
Another homicide makes me realise time is passing
Too much time is passing, so I'm going to the mountains for fasting
And that it takes place
Here I am, right back in your face with a revelation I gotta take to this nation
'Cause my people are dying of starvation, spiritually
So me, I jump on the stair, and relax
Grab my axe, and teach, over drum track, the facts which some lack
And that's the reason they act they way they act, thinking they're identifying with black
But ignorance is not black, though my people are straight-up portraying that
Selling crack in the communities, and then swearing that they're down with black unity

Yo, who ya fooling B?
Your own race, man
Are you down with the skin-heads or the klan?
I wanna know; yo, what's up with that?
Why are you so quick to peel brother man's
Cap another black on black
Shorty's locked up, home-girl's knocked up
Fell for the scam played by the male who swears he's a man
You might also likeHe never loved you, so like why should he care?
As he tells you to get on welfare
So, here we go, through the same old cycle
Playboy dad, fatherless child that'll probably just grow up buck-wild in poverty
Well, you're grabbing for something, but you're always coming back with nothing but broken dreams

Man, it seems straight useless, and that's the reason Slack produced this jam
Take of the blindfold, pushed there to realise you are the eyes of the church
And that's why ya like straight getting worked over time
'Cause once we fall in line, with a clear mind, it's revival time
So out comes the KJV 66, in goes the clip
I got my hand on the trigger, busting shots at the spirit called ""nigga""

A super shout-out to the Cush man
What you don't understand, the oldest son of Ham - Cush, the Cush man
Or, better yet, should I say Ethiopian?
A people, tall with smooth, brown skin
These parts of the bible seem to be forgotten
You see, it's not unknown, it's just not taught

I'll be the first one to pull the trigger, and kill that spirit called ""nigga"" that's been keeping my people way low, pretending everything is mellow
Well, I'm sending shouts to the ghetto
Know who you are, so you can reach your full potential
See, your history is not a mystery, it extends way beyond the sixteenth century

And the bible will clearly expose this, in Numbers 12:1, with Miriam and the wife of Moses
Interracial marriage, God didn't oppose this, but you won't find that looking at the video
Of course, you have to go to the source, and break free from the chains of the spirit that's left us all incoherent, and blind to the fact that Jesus washed that all at the cross
Some call it a tree; nevertheless, we're free - that means you and me
'Cause Jesus took the key, got up on the tree
So get rid of the peas, and pile Galatians 3:28 on your plate
Get your aim straight, and kill that spirit called ""nigga""
Spirits from hell are assigned against nations
Communities, races, a problem everyone faces
Devil, I'm taking authority over, in the name of Jesus
I bind and render your work, in order to shatter your plan to pieces

Apprehending the enemy
It's written that he should, and must be, bound before I enter and take his goods

Impart truth in ya, like an educated teacher
Living, though in time, in time, say, rhyme, preacher

Trained an equipped for war, armored still
Return to put the demons on the scope for kill

Prayed before we started, nigga spirit, we bought it
'Cause I'm addressing the last of the nigga spiritual target

As we rebuild and get rid of it
If you get it, you dig it
And we're not talking about the minute to find my anglo bits
Neither would a brother call another brother
We're speaking of a spirit that's the sign of black minds in all of mankind

Keeping you divided, envious, filled with greed, jealous of the next man - don't wanna see him succeed
Lazy and complaisant, with consumer mentality
Strangle and protect your genes and creativity
But God gives you the ability to obtain wealth
You're sticking out your hand, looking for help from someone else
Blaming it on the next man, feeling that you got to
But, with Christ and the Holy Ghost, nobody can stop you

To some, welfare is a curse from hell, no apology
Is the system designed to keep recipients in poverty?
If you're depending on the system, forgetting your gifts or job
And keep you from fulfilling your purpose in God

As soon as you get some money, you spend it with the careers
Never save or invest, but just so people can see 'em looking cool
But won't get a free PAEL grant for school
If your vision is blurry, clear it

My acclaim's critical, but I'm a fuckin' cynic
You're a fuckin' gimmick, mimic
Do it all for the image, but never really did it
I can't rest, I'm too wicked, I feel my mood switchin'
I ain't never gave nobody a problem who didn't want it
All you had to do was show me and I went and got it
There's an elephant in the room, but I'm sittin' on it
I got mental scars from this shit, but we're livin' off it
When they bring the streets up, I think you should switch the topic
If I'm bein' real, I don't mind, we can split the profit
I wake up and bill a rocket, last year, I saw my first M
This year, I need a couple profit, I got no timе to sit and gossip
And that's word to the trap I kicked in for the things I wantеd
Ambition like mine, let me know when you come across it
They'll probably come across it and then double-cross it
Make all of them mistakes and then learn nothin' from it
It hits a little different when you're comin' from it
The struggle, that's what made you, why you runnin' from it?
I been a real dope boy, you can't beat my grind
Can't break my spirit, in the shade, I shine
You need guns when you're mixed up in beef like mine
It's hard not to smile when you got some teeth like mine
Nanny told me, ""Don't go out there, boy, it's cold outside""
I question everything I stood for and rode my time
Time and time again, one of me and there's five of them
I bring my knees to my chest and I rise again
I don't care who I might offend
If you ain't love me in the first place, why pretend?
If I sit and think about all the nights I spent on some heartbroke shit
'Cah my body gave up, but my heart won't quit
I bought fourteen grams, but my half won't flip
I got laces and boots, goals and assists
Fifty jailhouse fades, on Neighbourhood Crip
I really live this shit, you're a rappin'-ass bitch
I lost so many mates, I rub shoulders with greats
On these council estate
Tenth floor in the stairs, we used to hide from the rain
Fell in love with the life just to hide from the shade
Still shine in the shade
Kill the ego, maintain, humble, I remain
Still, I go against the grain
Real back in style, let them hate 'cause they know we are what they ain't
I wanna tell you that I'm strugglin', but I can't find the words
I wanna stay with you forever, but I need some millions first
I know that seems surprising 'cause I been a trillionaire
Blue plates and plastic bowls, I don't come from silverware
Don't get yourself killed in here
Before I sleep, I say a prayer
They got bags of energy, but nothin' to declare
This life, it left me broke, I just need someone to repair
I watched him take a lift and kept on runnin' up the stairs
I can leave the streets and just rap, I got shares
I'm too busy gettin' mine to think about yours
You can ask Theo, he was tickin' me drawers
I won't talk about the people who was givin' me squares, I ain't forgettin'
Pissed down the block, screws put me on default
They let me out for dinner and I jumped on the nettin'
I'm more rejoicin' than regrettin'
'Cah if they never kicked my head in and stripped me naked and took my beddin'
If I never climbed out all the holes I fell in
If I never had scraps, I didn't know the swellin'
If I never sold smack, I didn't know what Hell is
Then it's freedom itself, I wouldn't know the blessin'
Then they wouldn't be callin' me the hope and message
Now we're copacetic, can we toast a beverage?
'Cah when you keep it real, you keep the leverage
Real back in style, real G's in attendanceYou might also likeEmbed",709,61994VOwX5tuXX6MMV5bsp,"{'danceability': 0.49, 'energy': 0.654, 'key': 11, 'loudness': -7.684, 'mode': 1, 'speechiness': 0.494, 'acousticness': 0.17, 'instrumentalness': 0, 'liveness': 0.166, 'valence': 0.617, 'tempo': 84.147, 'type': 'audio_features', 'id': '61994VOwX5tuXX6MMV5bsp', 'uri': 'spotify:track:61994VOwX5tuXX6MMV5bsp', 'track_href': 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/61994VOwX5tuXX6MMV5bsp', 'analysis_url': 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/61994VOwX5tuXX6MMV5bsp', 'duration_ms': 225605, 'time_signature': 4}",0.49,0.654,-7.684,0.494,0.17,0.0,0.166,0.617,84.147,225605,

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
You might also like[Bridge]
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

[Chorus]
For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug

White ash on my hotel floor room
Feds still watchin', hopin' they get bored soon
I'm bored of the fame, but that's my good fortune
I keep losin' all my friends and that subject's sore too
Never switch on me, I know I can't force you
I can't trust you, how could I endorse you?
I just hope you run with everything I taught you
I said I just hope you run with everything I taught you
I got white ash on these custom seats and I'm custer-free
Not talkin' in the car, they probably bugged the veecs
Go and hug your kids about you hug the streets
I don't smoke pagans, I smoke ganja leaf
I got guns for beef and leave sons deceasеd
He's always talkin' the most, but he doеs the least
We go kway back, I known him since dungarees
Probably hate me 'cause I know you never done the greaze
'Magine if we went school, we could've done degrees
'Stead we was sellin' crack, bitch, run the P's
Now I'm a rap star, they think I fund the streets
I got white ash on my kitchen counter
Smoke in my eye while I sit and count
I keep thinkin' 'bout yesterday's encounter
I know they're schemin' on me, I'ma lick him down
I seen man run for his life and get disembowelled
And his friends don't ride, they just miss him now
And he raps and they all wanna diss him now
Either that or they're all arse-lickin' now
I got white ash in the boardroom
I'm rappin' with execs, they're actin' all cordial
You're an informer and they treat me informal
My kids are adorable
I'm head of the family, I make it affordable
I'm killin' the rap game and holdin' memorials
Subscribe to my YouTube, I'm givin' tutorials
I rose from the crack smoke, that's different euphorias
White ash in his pipe, Frank White, I'm notorious
I was kippin' in Gloria's
Paid three for the rent, steady livin' inglorious
They ain't tryna do it, not unless there's an audience
Not a leg to stand on, he's still shootin', he think he's Oscar Pistorius
White ash on my booth floor, I don't need a chorus
They'll have you stuck in time and the jails are Victorian
My licence just done and I'm feelin' victorious
I'm curvin' all these bitches, they ain't got no decorum
I got white ash on my hotel floor room
Feds still watchin', hopin' they get bored soon
I'm bored of the fame, but that's my good fortune
I keep losin' all my friends and that subject's sore too
White ash on my kitchen counter
Smoke in my eye while I sit and count

Since I've gotten older
I've realized we all care about things that don't really matter
We're just told it does

[Pre-Chorus]
And now, we're all tryna keep our heads above the water
But what if we don't wanna?

[Chorus]
If there's something you wanna do
Just do it
Don't let your head stop your heart from moving
If there's someone you wanna talk to
Talk to 'em
Who knows who we'd be if we just
Live more and love more
We all just need to live more and lovе more

[Verse 2]
When we'rе not here anymore
It all comes down to who we were and what we stood for
Not what we had and not where we lived
So when we're told it does

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe then we'll see we don't just have to keep our heads above the water
Not if we don't wanna

[Bridge]
So hug your kids, tell them you love them
Have some heart, but make sure it's open
Take that risk 'cause time gets stolen
Maybe speak less and listen more
'Cause life's too short, you only have one
It might sound cliché
But your life can start when you choose it to
When you choose it to

'Cause if there's something you wanna do
Just do it
Don't let your head stop your heart from moving

[Verse 1: Potter Payper]
I link T on my just rap, you can blow shit
Still think I'm Boston George on my blow shit
My boy's in a SVR, but he stole it
I flew past **** with my wap, told him hold it
Man keep talkin' my name, they keep trollin'
When they're more pussy than the pussyoles they roll with
Can't be pillow talkin' in these streets, I disown him (Yo)
Can't be talkin' about me, I kick doors in (Check)

[Verse 2: Tunde]
I link P on my jack jones in the morning
He was one up too 'cause we're staunch and they know this
My boys in a SRT, he didn't rent it
Took chase from the black bonnet and he bent it
I flew past the back of the еstate to go and pick him up
I sent Cappy round therе and told him, ""Go and lift him up""
'Cause man keep chattin' man name, they keep cappin' it
But one ****, so now I keep **** it

[Verse 3: Potter Payper]
I've been buying watches and guns, that's insurance
Runnin' this for ten years runnin', that's endurance
I ain't worried bout nobody, they're all jokers
Like I ain't been steppin' with hammers and big boarers
Standin' on strip corners, scammers and extorters
Came too far to be standing with informers

Talk 'bout the duppies and then it just gets awkward again (Yo)

Might fly to a gallery and grip a painting
Used to sleep on floors, I don't need persuading
Now mummy got a CC purse with suede in
But bitch, I'd rather be rich than famous

[Verse 6: Tunde]
'Cause bitch, I'd rather be rich than famous
Got stitched by the pigs and it hit the papers
Snitch boys in the ends, gotta ditch the haters
All rats must die with a suit from Slaters

Fast Car,Luke Combs,Gettin' Old,89,"5 ContributorsFast Car Lyrics[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising and entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
Said I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

Maybe I would never have to miss you

I wish that I could hold you close
Now I'm driving past your house, I know

I'm from the hood, now I live in a mansion
These niggas are mad, I'm counting these bags while I sit in a Phantom
Word to my jewellers, I spent quarter mill on my wrist and medallion
They said I'm ugly, and now I get money she thinks that I'm handsome
Touched down Dubai with the gang and we had a fun night
Went straight to the Louis V shop, from there we went Club White
Remember them days on the estate when we had to fight over nitties
Now it's tour dates and all these bitches ask me to sign on their titties
Won't see me in a club with no shank, fam, I always bring my strally
Before I went jail I was selling stardawg and bricks of ammi
When I had no packs I had to take a trip to Cali
I ain't even bring no suitcase, I just bought a list of addys
They ain't trapping like me, we ain't got the same quotes
If you ain't tryna buy a yacht next year, we ain't in the same boat

I just left mummy's house
The runners down on my feet, two and a Q
Respect from my niggas up in the trap
If it weren't for rap I'd be in there too
The feds, they hate me
They know I done some shavings bait but left no clue
Brought a hunting knife to war
Cah the three-eight never had no shoes
Told me she's leaving, why?
Cause I'm a rapper wasting her time
She hates when I'm up in DXB
Cause she knows what I do in Dubai
I end up giving them dick
I step in the club and never say ""Hi""
Then end up bussing my nut
And book her a cab, I never said ""Bye""
Course I got money, you can tell by the rip in my jeans
I'm at an awards show with my niggas daydreamin' bout hitting the fiends
I ride out sober, me and big homie pull up on the opps, drinking their lean
On road he was the baddest, went to jail now he on his deen
My niggas, they tell me to chill
Saying I spend too much on jackets
When it's time for guns I buy them, I think I spend too much on mashes
I buy waps but I'm into fashion, rather the Culli than the Phantom
I got a couple hoes from Glasgow
They just wanna fuck on me and the mandem

It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde, fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?""
Got no alibi

[Pre-Chorus]
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

[Chorus]
Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast, burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?

Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can

You promise it won't happen again
So when you get fucked up on a night out
How many times have you played around?
Was a fool, didn't see the signs
I guess my friends were always right

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, look at what you've done
You said you'd never do
You've fucked it for yourself
This is the end of me and you

[Chorus]
So don't call this number anymore
'Cause I won't be there for you like I was before
I should have listened to my friends
They always know best
They said you were just like all the rest, so
I'll sing it loud in case you don't already know
Pack up your shit and go, go, go, go
Go, go, go
Pack up your shit and go, go, go, go
Go, go, go
[Bridge]
I can't trust you anymore
Look what you've done
You've turned this heart cold
And I don't know if I can love again
But I know for sure we can't be friends
This is the end

[Chorus]
So don't call this number anymore
'Cause I won't be there for you like I was before
I should have listened to my friends
They always know best
They said you were just like all the rest, so
I'll sing it loud in case you don't already know

So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly

I remember the sickness was forever
I remember snuff videos
Cold Septembers, the distances we covered
The fist fights on the beach
The Bizzies round us up
Do it all again next week
An embryonic love
The first time that it scarred
Embarrass yourself for someone
Cryin' like a child
And the boy who kicked Tom's head in
Still bugs me now
That's the thing, it lingers
And claws you when you're down

[Verse 2]
I was far too scared to hit him
But I would hit him in a heartbeat now
That's the thing with anger, it begs to stick around
So it can fleece you of your beauty
And leave you spent with nowt to offer
Makes you hurt the ones who love you

[Chorus]
You hurt them like they're nothin'

It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in
'Nough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on a private jet
Life or death, five-five
Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

[Verse 1]
I do know my man, but I don't trust him
Trust that, Ps in the trap, disgustin'
Stick with the stick, PVA, PDA, kiss that in public

South London's where I made my first hundred
Elastic bands, plastic bags, two and a blue like cheese and onion
In Jamaica, quick vacation, travellin' my pastimе

Any girl that I'm datin' knows, bags that I buy come filled with fifties
She a ten out of ten on a bad day, public affection, I tell her, ""Come kiss me""
I like mine obsessed, clingy
If she don't miss me, miss me
If she don't miss me, history
If she don't miss me, it's a mystery
G17 in the party, tipsy
Don't drink, that's risky
Focus, shells gonna land like Disney
And put him down under, Sydney
That's bae, I'll donate both my kidneys
True love, what the kid needs
And a girl from the Westest Indies

In this world that I'm in
How you wanna take pics with the belts in the ring
But don't help in the gym?
'Nough girls datin' their biggest haters
How her boyfriend don't want her to win? Like, rah
And why my girlfriend never wanna see me have a good time out if she ain't there?
Yeah, yeah (Fly— Fly me to the moon)
Fly me to the moon, let me get some space
Seein' them stars on her private story
I dust that chick, she got no grace

See her ex man, she got no taste, hip dip, she got no waist
Body snatched, servin' face (In other words, hold my hand)
Haha, hold my hand, personal trainer

Free my gang, 013's and 020's (Darlin' miss me)

But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence

Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

[Chorus]
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
Up

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

Comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm fallin' asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's takin' a drag
Now they're goin' to bed, and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

[Pre-Chorus]
Chest now, he takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

I'm givin' my lady some drivin' lessons in a hundred-grand Jeep
When you see me in public, no photos, man, I need some privacy please
Good girl, she just sat on my face now she's sayin' her legs have gone weak
Bad, bad, see the jakes outside, now I'm flushin' the work down the toilet
Mad, mad, Richard Mille, a crib by the port and it's imported
Sad, sad, if you knew the truth 'bout that nigga then it would get awkward
And I know that nigga get money now, I am the nigga that taught him

[Verse 1: Young Adz]
Bro, I get the birds in, fuck a drought
Worker is misbehavin', chuck him out
I get the money, money from her house
Out in a lovely, lovely country town
I said, if you care about her, fly her out
Go to the Louis store and buy it now
I'ma keep pourin' 'til I'm runnin' out
I just hit it from the back, she scared, she runnin' out
Ooh, young and lit, money keep on comin' in
Ooh, I keep a rock band on standby, pull up and drum that shit
Ooh, deep in it, I'ma swim, hand on heart, I love this chick
Ooh, all them niggas 'round me family, love them on some brother shit

[Verse 2: Central Cee]
She suck my soul, she done it like Ash Kaash, I keep on gettin' them flashbacks
I was OT so I had to bash, I almost thought about gettin' a cab back
Do it like Rico and video that, if we upload it,  it'll probably get some backlash
Backshots, she got the ripple effect, it's too temptin' and I can't help but slap that
Fuck that, pull out, I don't wanna be a dad yet
Plan B, girl, you gotta swallow that tablet
The way that she handle it, this one talented
Pum-pum soakin', feel like I'm paddlin'
Back come 'round, I'm a fan of it
Ride on a bike one time and saddle it (Oh)
Ayo, her doctor workin' wonders
Damn, that's a big circumference (Oh)
Get her wet, she don't need no lube
On the fortieth floor, you should see the views (Alright)
She don't wanna send me her pussy on Snapchat, madman, I don't wanna leak your nudes
How do I say it without seemin' rude? (Huh)
I just wanna see if it's cute
Shake that back like a video vixen
This one here don't wanna be in my tunes
She wanna go Nobu just for the Snap
If I pay for the tab, you best eat your food
Word on the road is Cench get a hunnid a show
This ho' wan' see if it's true
Posh ting, she don't wanna be with the squares no more, she said she wanna be with the goons
Thought she could hack it, not active, too smoky, now she wanna leave the room

Bad, bad, see the jakes outside, now I'm flushin' the work down the toilet
Mad, mad, Richard Mille, a crib by the port and it's imported
Sad, sad, if you knew the truth 'bout that nigga then it would get awkward
And I know that nigga get money now, I am the nigga that taught him

[Verse 3: Dirtbike LB]
I love the trap (Trap)
Quarter milli on cars ain't never enough (Enough)
Couple milli, I put it aside, cop me a villa in Marbs (In Marbs)
She need ten racks for her arse, I said, bro, ""I'll put that on my dargs"" (Put that on my dargs)
My killers still swervin' the Rona but that ain't the reason for masks (Yeah)
I fill up the drum and it's kickin' away, spin it back like I'm target (Yeah)
I sat in my kitchen, I'm whippin' away and I'm droppin' off white with no garlic
It's a carousel when I'm spinnin' the tray, hate when my flight is delayed (Delayed)
I tell my lil' nigga, ""Go flex in my Rollie, no money to waste"" (Waste)

[Chorus: Young Adz]
The year has just started and right now, I'm lookin' for cribs overseas
I'm givin' my lady some drivin' lessons in a hundred-grand Jeep
When you see me in public, no photos, man, I need some privacy please
Good girl, she just sat on my face now she's sayin' her legs have gone weak
Bad, bad, see the jakes outside, now I'm flushin' the work down the toilet
Mad, mad, Richard Mille, a crib by the port and it's imported
Sad, sad, if you knew the truth 'bout that nigga then it would get awkward

I don't want a lot for Christmas

More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)

There upon the fireplace (Ah)
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

I'm the strong one, I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the Earth is
I move mountains, I move churches
And I glow, 'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is
Got a rough, indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum, I find 'em, I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but

[Verse 1]
Under the surface
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like, ""Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus?""
Under the surface
I'm pretty surе I'm worthless if I can't be of servicе

[Pre-Chorus]
A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back
What breaks the camel's back, it's

[Chorus]
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer
Who am I if I can't carry it all?
If I falter
You might also like[Verse 2]
Under the surface
I hide my nerves and it worsens, I worry somethin' is gonna hurt us
Under the surface
The ship doesn't swerve, has it heard how big the iceberg is?
Under the surface
I think about my purpose, can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominoes, a light wind blows
You try to stop it tumbling, but on and on it goes

[Bridge]
But wait, if I could shake the crushing weight of expectations
Would that free some room up for joy
Or relaxation, or simple pleasure?
Instead, we measure this growing pressure
Keeps growing, keep going, 'cause all we know is

[Chorus]
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt and
See if she can handle every family burden
Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
No mistakes, just
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister and never wonder
If the same pressure would've pulled you under

Days ache and nights are long
Two years and still, you're not gone
Guess I'm still holding on
Drag my name through the dirt
Somehow it doesn't hurt though
Guess you're still holding on
You told your friends you want me dead
And said that I did everything wrong
And you're not wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I'll take all the vitriol
But not the thought of you moving on

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me
I'd rather hear how much you regret me
And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me
Oh, I hate to know I made you cry
But love to know I cross your mind, babe, oh, I
Even aftеr all, it'd still wreck me
To find out you know how to forget mе

(You liar, now I'ma set your house on fire)

[Verse 1]
I made friends with the head of police
To make sure he’d suspect me the least
If I'm caught I'd be out in a week
I got my story straight down to a T

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I’d say, ""It wasn't me"", hm
And sure we dated once in a while
But if there was a motive, it's not enough for a trial

[Chorus]
I saw you out it was zero degrees
And you had your hands right under her sleeves
Oh, you said you don't get cold
You liar!
Now I'ma set your house on fire
Running, I'm running back to your place
With gas and a match, it'll go up in flames
Now, I know you're not at home
You liar!
Now I’ma set your house on fire

If somеbody goes and calls the brigade
I’ll alrеady be too far away
I brought a map and I've planned the escape
I’ll dye my hair, change my name

[Pre-Chorus]
You should've seen this from the start
When you could've been honest, you could've been smart
Yeah, we might’ve touched, we might've kissed
But darling, I'm sorry, it's not enough to convict

[Chorus]
I saw you out it was zero degrees
And you had your hands right under her sleeves
Oh, you said you don't get cold
You liar!
Now I'ma set your house on fire
Running, I'm running back to your place
With gas and a match, it'll go up in flames
Now, I know you're not at home
You liar!
Now I'ma set your house on fire

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'ma set your house on fire
You liar!
Now I'ma set your house on fire

[Verse 1]
You want the girl with the small waist
And the perfect smile
Someone who's out every weekday
In her dad's new car
You tell me I shouldn't stress out
Say, ""It's not that hard""
But I just got a feeling
This will leave an ugly scar

[Pre-Chorus]
If you say, ""She's nothing to worry about""
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?

[Chorus]
Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind
One day wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't havе
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad
Shе's got everything that I don't have, hm-mm

You want someone you can show off
Whenever you go out
She'll wear a tight mini black dress
With all her friends around
And then you'll probably spend the night at
Her nice big house
And by then I'll just be someone
You've forgotten about, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
If you say, ""She's nothing to worry about""
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?

[Verso 1: Future]
Você reza pelos meus demônios, garota, eu entendo você
Toda vez que eu bebo codeína, fico vulnerável
Eu conheço os sons da tempestade quando ela chеga
Ela entende quе eu não posso levar ela pra todos os lugares que eu vou
Eu estive no campo tipo os filhos do milho

[Refrão: Future & Tems]
Eu posso ouvir suas lágrimas quando elas caem pelo telefone
Fica brava consigo mesma porque não consegue me deixar em paz
Fofoca, arrumando bagunça, isso não é o que estamos fazendo (O mundo estava acabando)
Viajar ao redor do mundo (Você choraria ou tentaria me pegar?)
Pelo telefone, derramando lágrimas (Me diga agora, eu quero que você seja claro, yeah)
Eu fico mais vulnerável quando tomo pílulas (Me diga agora, eu quero que você seja claro, yeah)
Quando você tá bêbada, você me diz exatamente como se sente (Eu vou esperar por você, por você)
Quando eu tô carregado, mantenho a real (Eu vou esperar por você, vou esperar por você)
Por favor, fala pra um verdadeiro exatamente o que é (Eu vou esperar, vou esperar, por você, por você)
Não diga isso porque você sabe que é isso que eu quero ouvir (Eu vou esperar por você, vou esperar por você)

Yeah, eu estive viajando ao redor do mundo
Eu sento na minha varanda e me pergunto como você tá se sentindo
Eu tenho uma carreira que tira meu tempo das mulheres
Eu não posso te convencer de que eu te amo pra sempre (Vou esperar por você, por você)
Eu vou estar te ligando, os sentimentos estão fluindo como um rio
Você vai estar mandando mensagens de volta pra Kiki no rio (Eu vou esperar por você)
A mensagem foi entregue (Eu vou esperar por você), mas eu sei que você não leu
Por que você nos apresenta se você sabia que tava com ele? (Eu vou esperar por você, por você, por você)
Me fez apertar a mão dele quando vocês estavam transando à um minuto (Eu vou esperar por você, por você)
Me fez caminhar na prancha, porque você sabe que eu sou um nadador (Eu vou esperar por você)
Eu deveria ser seu cachorro, mas você me colocou num canil
Garota, coloque uma focinheira nisso, em todos aqueles latidos durante o jantar
Eu tava fechado com você quando você ganhou o Presidencial pequeno
Você melhorou quando me conheceu e isso não é coincidência
Tentei trazer o melhor de você, acho que eu não sou tão influente
Acho que eu não sou o cara para você

I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home

To carry love, to carry children of our own

This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip, hip, hooray, love

[Pre-Chorus]
Photographs in sepia tones
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both

[Chorus]
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

[Verse 2]
This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it
Leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us
Or even erase us

And I wake up and I don't see your name on my phone
It’s in the moments where I think that I’m better alone
That's when I remember, that's when I remember

And I tell myself that you were the biggest mistake
And just when I think I’m finally doing okay

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me

You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)

[Verse 2]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

Funny, now I hate you

And all your daddy issues
But now, I don't even miss you anymore

All the hours spent givin' advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
When you said you loved me
Well, you must've had your fingers crossed

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

[Verse 1]
Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

[Verse 2]
Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

[Chorus]
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

If I was an astronaut, I'd be floating in mid-air
And a broken heart would just belong
To someone else down there
I would be the center of my lonely universe
But I'm only human and I'm crashing down to Earth

[Verse 2]
If I was an astronaut, I'd have a bird's eye view
I'd circle round the world and keep on coming back to you
In my floating castle, I'd rub shoulders with the stars
But I'm only human and I'm drifting in the dark

[Chorus]
I'm up in space, man
Up in space, man
I've searched around the universe
Been down some black holes
There's nothing but space, man
And I wanna go home

[Verse 3]
If I was an astronaut, I'd speak to satеllites
My navigation systems would search for othеr life
But I'd be up here thinking 'bout what I left behind
'Cause I'm only human with the real world on my mind

Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid
He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember

These are the nights that never die (Good job, Sho)

See, I ain't really into the verbal
My broski strapped, no Dijk, no Virgil
The van might buss that circle
See, I'm tryna blow off this music ting
And pray that I end up commercial
And 'bout time that I make some records
Show them why that I go universal
('Cause I can't) 'Cause I can't get stuck in the ends
I need me a yard with a big ass fence
Lambo truck or Mercedes-Benz
No fake love, no need to pretend
If I cut you off, it's straight intent
Guys out here tryna drill and repent
Same bad B that I need in defence
The J1's coulda been A1, but I can't follow the latest trends
Broski might handle the can and let off shots, 'cause the bullets bisexual
It's really for them boy there, can definitely hit that bitch right next to you
Every time I rap on the beat, gotta show them why man feels presentable
And chicks love pick and choose their guys like a video game collectible

Got my bro like Zack got Cody
I'm a top boy like Modie (Ah-ah)
Anti-social, I don't like to socialize
They cap on the net, that's social lies
When brodie died, I cried, that's real life
I feel a way, I just don't feel right
Could've been homeless
My heart so cold, it's frozen
DTB, I find it hard to open
I've been busy livin' life in the moment
Reason why I ain't got time to lotion
[Chorus: SwitchOTR]
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members
My niggas riding if you violate one the guys
You-you better hide, you better stay inside
'Cause we're coming for you
Sometimes, man, I look up to the sky
I'll-I'll ask my God, why I lost a couple members

How can I be homophobic? My bitch is gay
Hit man in the top, try see a man topless, even the stick is gay
Huggin' my bruddas and say that I love them, but I don't swing that way
The mandem celebrate Eid, the trap still runnin' on Christmas day

Somebody tell Doja Cat that I'm tryna indulge in that
In my grey tracksuit, see the bulge in that
See the motion clap when you're throwin' it back (When you're throwin' it back)
These females plannin' on doin' me wrong
So I'm grabbin' a 'dom out the Trojan pack
Post the location after we're gone
Can't slip and let them know where we're at
I don't know about you, but I valuе my life (But I value my life)
'Causе imagine I die (Die)
And I ain't made a hundred Ms yet
There's so much things I ain't done yet
Like fuckin' a flight attendant, huh
I don't party, but I heard Cardi there, so fuck it, I might attend it
Gotta kick back sometimes and wonder
How life would've been if I never did take them risks and would have I prospered?
Floatin' and I won't go under
Been outta town for a month
Absence made the love grow fonder
UK rap or UK drill, gotta mention my name if you talk 'bout the genre (Alright)

'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be

And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken

Drawers!
Floors!
Doors!
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Mirabel & Ensemble, Both]
This is our home, we've got every generation
So full of music, the rhythm of its own design
This is my family, a perfect constellation
So many stars and everybody gets to shine
Woah (Oh-oh-oh-oh), let's be clear, Abuela runs this show
Woah (Oh-oh-oh-oh), she led us here so many years ago
Woah (Oh-oh-oh-oh), and every year our family blessings grow!
There's just a lot, you simply got to know, so

[Chorus: Mirabel]
Welcome to the Family Madrigal
The home of the Family Madrigal (We're on our way!)
Wherе all the people arе fantastical and magical
I'm part of the Family Madrigal

[Interlude 1]
[Alejandra, Juancho & Cecilia] ""Oh my gosh, it's them!""
[Alejandra] ""What are the gifts?""
[Cecilia] ""I can't remember all the gifts""
[Alejandra] ""But I don't know who is who""
[Mirabel] ""Mm-mm-, alright, alright, relax!""
[Alejandra] ""It is physically impossible to relax!""
[Cecilia] ""Tell us everything! What are your powers?""
[Juancho] ""Just tell us what everyone can do!""

My tía Pepa, her mood affects the weather
When she's unhappy, well, the temperature gets weird
My tío Bruno (We don't talk about Bruno!)
They say he saw the future, one day he disappeared
Oh (Oh-oh-oh-oh), and that's my mom Julieta, here's her deal
Woah! (Oh-oh-oh-oh), the truth is, she can heal you with a meal
Woah! (Oh-oh-oh-oh), her recipes are remedies for real
If you're impressed, imagine how I feel—Mom!

[Chorus: Mirabel, Mirabel, Felix & Agustín]
Welcome to the Family Madrigal
The home of the Family Madrigal (Hey, coming through!)
I know it sounds a bit fantastical and magical
But I'm part of the Family Madrigal
Two guys fell in love with Family Madrigal (Hey, Family Madrigal!)
And now they're part of the Family Madrigal
So, yeah, Tío Félix married Pepa and my dad married Julieta
That's how Abuela became an Abuela Madrigal (Let's go, let's go!)

[Verse 3: Abuela]
We swear to always help those around us
And earn the miracle that somehow found us
The town keeps growing, the world keeps turning
But work and dedication will keep the miracle burning
And each new generation must keep the miracle burning
[Interlude 2]
[Alejandra] ""Wait— who's a sister and who's a cousin?""
[Cecilia] ""There's so many people!""
[Juancho] ""How do you keep them all straight?""
[Mirabel] Okay, okay, okay, okay

[Bridge: Mirabel & Townspeople]
So many kids in our house, so let's turn the sound up!
You know why? I think it's time for a grandkid round-up!
(Grandkid round-up!)

[Verse 4: Mirabel & Townspeople, Both]
Cousin Dolores can hear a pin drop
Camilo shapeshifts, Antonio gets his gift today
My older sisters, Isabela and Luisa
One strong, one graceful, perfect in every way
(Isabela!) Grows a flower, the town goes wild
(Isabela!) She's the perfect golden child
(Luisa! Luisa! Luisa! Luisa!) And Luisa's super strong
The beauty and the brawn do no wrong

[Chorus: Mirabel & Ensemble]
That's life in the Family Madrigal (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now you know the Family Madrigal (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Where all the people are fantastical and magical (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
That's who we are in the Family Madrigal
[Interlude 3]
[Mirabel] ¡Adiós! ""Ooo!""
[Alejandra] ""But what's your gift?""
[Mirabel] Ha!

[Chorus: Mirabel & Ensemble]
Well, I gotta go, the life of a Madrigal (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
But now you all know the Family Madrigal (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I never meant this to get autobiographical (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
So just to review the Family Madrigal, let's go

[Verse 5: Mirabel & Children]
(But what about Mirabel?)
It starts with Abuela, and then Tía Pepa, she handles the weather
(But what about Mirabel?)
My mom Julieta can make you feel better with just one arepa
(But what about Mirabel?)
My dad Agustín, well, he's accident-prone but he means well
(But what about Mirabel?)
Hey, you said you wanna know what everyone does, I got sisters and cousins and (Mirabel!)
My primo Camilo won't stop until he makes you smile today (Mirabel!)
My cousin Dolores can hear this whole chorus a mile away (Mirabel!)
Look! It's Mister Mariano, hey
You can marry my sister if you wanna
But between you and me, she's kind of a prima donna
Yo, I've said too much, and thank you but I really gotta go! (Mirabel!)
My family's amazing! (Mirabel!)
And I'm in my family, so (Mirabel!)
Well

Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
And by now, you shoulda somehow realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Verse 2]
And backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay

See, I ain't the trustin' type and it's lust, not lovе

You make love to me like I'm the one
Then run off and duck my calls for a month
Make me feel special and then like a mug
Got you up in my guts but I hate your guts""
I come back, darling, why you rantin'?
Girl, I'm single, and I always have been
Never promised you nothin' but panting
Sweating 'em plans on a late night antics

Double D, big full breasts on my baby
(Yo, we going to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this

[Chorus]
Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

[Verse 2]
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
(There he goes, one of God's own prototypes)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
(Too weird to live, too rare to die)
No, I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get caught?

Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, and the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Verse 2]
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through

Go and take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose

[Pre-Chorus]
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

To somehow escape the burning wait, the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine

Sunlight comes creepin' in
Illuminates our skin
We watched the day go by
Stories of all we did
It made me think of you
It made me think of you

[Verse 2]
Under a trillion stars
We danced on top of cars
Took pictures of the stage
So far from where we are
They made me think of you
They made me think of you

[Chorus]
Oh, lights go down
In the moment, we're lost and found
I just wanna be by your side
If these wings could fly
For the rest of our lives

[Verse 3]
I'm in a foreign state
My thoughts, they slip away
My words are leavin' me
They caught an aeroplane
Because I thought of you
Just from the thought of you

Oh, lights go down
In the moment, we're lost and found

If these wings could fly
Oh, damn these walls

And how you told me after it all
We'd remember tonight
For the rest of our lives

If these wings could fly

Oh, lights go down
In the moment, we're lost and found

That one day I will be, where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, they're much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call? (Who's to say you won't hear me?)
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, they're much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

Still got scars on my back from your knives

All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't

Right, I shoulda known you were bad news
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos
'Cause most guys only want one thing
But I'm undecided, tryna figure out if that's you
Either way though, I think you're worth a test drive
'Cause (Ooh) you're so much better than the next guy
And a little trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign

[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
Don't you come here thinkin' you're ballin' (Oh, nah)
Ain't down for it, you seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean and the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so fresh and clean, smells like trouble to me

Opposites attract, I guess this is that
Good girl, bad guy, what a perfect match
And if we (Ooh), you're gon' wanna pay back tithes

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

Hit it in a bath, hit it on a couch

Poured it down, so I poured it down

We're crying, crying, so let the velvet roll down, down

[Pre-Chorus 2: Parson James]
No heroes, villains, one to blame
While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone
Our debut was a masterpiece
Our lines, we read so perfectly
But the show, it can't go on

[Chorus: Parson James]
We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause, oh
And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow
Oh it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show (Oh)
At least we stole the show (Oh)

[Drop: Parson James]
At least we stole the show
Stole the show
Stole the show
Stole the show
At least we stole the show
Stole the show
We stole the show

When the beat drops out
And the people gone
Will you still be there, still be there for me child
When the lights go out and the morning come
Will you still be there, still be there for me child
When the beat drops out

[Verse 1]
Life happens when you're making plans
Flying high and shaking hands
A song will write you, you don't write it
I, didn't mean to fall in love
Was rhythm that created us
I was running, we collided

[Pre-Chorus]
Baseline, I will always make time
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart for me
Baseline, after all the great times
I just wanna know that feelings in your heart

Lately you've been quiet
Is there something on your mind, baby?
The suspense is killing me
So much that it's driving me crazy
The three words in your head
Drift ahead like they're gonna come save me
Oh, lately you've been quiet
Is there something on your mind, baby?

[Chorus]
Baby, if you wanna say something, say it now
Cause I ain't got the time to be waiting around
Come on, tell me what you're feeling, use your mouth
If you wanna say something, say it now

[Verse 2]
You've been going out
Without doubt, what's going on baby?
I can see it in your eyes
Far behind and it's driving me crazy
Just tell me where you go
Cause I really need to know, please tell me
I'm so tired every day
Listening to the little that you're saying (that you say to me)

Blank Space,Taylor Swift,1989 (Deluxe),88,"239 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolPortuguêsPolskiΕλληνικάFrançaisBlank Space Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far

Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

I've touched your wanting hand
I'll put my love on the line
Yes I hope you'll understand

In those one night affairs
What I need is somebody who will always be there

Don't you promise me the world

Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
Holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

[Bridge: Jasmine Thompson]
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh-whoa-oh-oh

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable

I really wanna stop, but I just got the taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon
So honey, hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah

Late night watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

[Chorus]
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?
Oh, did I say too much?
I’m so in my head when we’re out of touch
I really, really, really, really, really, really like you
And I want you, do you want me, do you want me too?

It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah, we could stay alone
You and me, and this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by a thread, baby

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone

And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

I came here with a broken heart that no one else could see
I drew a smile on my face to paper over me
But wounds heal when tears dry and cracks they don't show
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me
Was not who I'm supposed to be
I felt this darkness over me
We all get there eventually
I never knew where I belonged
But I was right and you were wrong
Been telling myself all along

[Chorus]
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me

Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, I
I learned to wave goodbye
How not to see my life
Through someone else's eyes
It's not an easy road
But now I'm not alone
So I, I won't be so hard on myself no more

[Chorus]
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone

[Verse 1]
I've been spinnin' now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sippin' on red wine
I've been sittin' here for ages
Rippin' out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind

[Chorus]
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in

Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid""

Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, ""Keep our business on the low-low""
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five

You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
[Verse 2: Kanye West & Paul McCartney]
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
We can run
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
I'm on a mystery
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

[Chorus: Rihanna & Kanye West]
Yeah, I'm 'bout four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that’s all I want

Thinkin', ""How could I be so selfish?""
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', ""How could I be so reckless?""
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand, yeah

[Verse 3: Kanye West with Rihanna]
If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness (Mhm)
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'

Take Me To Church,Hozier,The Singer Songwriter,25,"339 ContributorsTranslationsفارسیEspañolFrançaisDeutschTake Me to Church Lyrics[Produced by Hozier and Rob Kirwan]
[Video directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson]
[Verse 1]
My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
Aaa, Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
[Bridge]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life1.6KEmbed",462,1CS7Sd1u5tWkstBhpssyjP,"{'danceability': 0.566, 'energy': 0.664, 'key': 4, 'loudness': -5.303, 'mode': 0, 'speechiness': 0.0464, 'acousticness': 0.634, 'instrumentalness': 0, 'liveness': 0.116, 'valence': 0.437, 'tempo': 128.945, 'type': 'audio_features', 'id': '1CS7Sd1u5tWkstBhpssyjP', 'uri': 'spotify:track:1CS7Sd1u5tWkstBhpssyjP', 'track_href': 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/1CS7Sd1u5tWkstBhpssyjP', 'analysis_url': 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/1CS7Sd1u5tWkstBhpssyjP', 'duration_ms': 241693, 'time_signature': 4}",0.566,0.664,-5.303,0.0464,0.634,0.0,0.116,0.437,128.945,241693,
King,Years & Years,Communion (Deluxe),63,"37 ContributorsKing Lyrics[Verse 1]
I caught you watching me under the light
Can I realign?
They say it’s easy to leave you behind
I don’t wanna try

[Pre-Chorus]
Cut cover, take that test
Hold courage to your chest
Don’t wanna wait for you
Don’t wanna have to lose all that I've compromised
To feel another high
I’ve got to keep it down tonight

[Chorus]
And, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I was a king under your control
And, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna feel like you've let me go
So let me go

[Verse 2]
Don’t you remember how I used to like being on the line?
I dreamed you dreamed of me calling out my name
Is it worth the price?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Cut cover, take that test
Hold courage to your chest
Don’t wanna wait for you
Don’t wanna have to lose all that I've compromised
To feel another high
I’ve got to keep it down tonight

[Chorus]
And, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I was a king under your control
And, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna feel like you've let me go

[Bridge]
I had to break myself to carry on
No love and no admission
Take this from me tonight
Oh-oh, let's fight
Oh-oh-oh, let's fight
Oh-oh, let's fight
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
And, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I was a king under your control
And, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna feel like you’ve let me go
So let me go
[Outro]
Let go, let go, let go of everything
Let go, let go, let go of everything
Let go, let go, let go of everything
Let go, let go, let go of everything78Embed",261,5WbfFTuIldjL9x7W6y5l7R,"{'danceability': 0.73, 'energy': 0.355, 'key': 10, 'loudness': -9.13, 'mode': 0, 'speechiness': 0.0359, 'acousticness': 0.154, 'instrumentalness': 0.00155, 'liveness': 0.117, 'valence': 0.56, 'tempo': 142.143, 'type': 'audio_features', 'id': '5WbfFTuIldjL9x7W6y5l7R', 'uri': 'spotify:track:5WbfFTuIldjL9x7W6y5l7R', 'track_href': 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/5WbfFTuIldjL9x7W6y5l7R', 'analysis_url': 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/5WbfFTuIldjL9x7W6y5l7R', 'duration_ms': 202653, 'time_signature': 4}",0.73,0.355,-9.13,0.0359,0.154,0.00155,0.117,0.56,142.143,202653,https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/baecbe653387e939a4e2c96005b7bf9ae763b098?cid=a4bf3a6d2a1640eeaff76c0764a15e10
